Operation Mockingbird Evidence Integration
Integrates CIA media manipulation and propaganda network intelligence into Sherlock

This represents systematic CIA control of global media apparatus (1950s-1970s+)
connecting to broader pattern of intelligence-media fusion documented in other operations.

Key Intelligence:
- "Wisner's Wurlitzer" - 800+ propaganda assets at peak
- 50+ owned/subsidized media entities worldwide
- 1,000+ books produced/subsidized
- Systematic "blowback" to American public acknowledged
- Integration with documented coups (Guatemala, Chile, Iran)

Architecture: Similar to MK-Ultra/Italy UFO/JFK integration
Output: Evidence sources, claims, speakers, relationships
