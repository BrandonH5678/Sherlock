Vatican Sexual Abuse Cover-Up Evidence Integration
Integrates 1962 Vatican document and institutional cover-up intelligence into Sherlock

Key Intelligence:
- 1962 "Crimen sollicitationis" document - 69-page Latin instruction from Pope John XXIII
- Threatened excommunication for those who spoke out about sexual abuse
- May 2001 Vatican letter (Cardinal Ratzinger) confirmed 1962 instruction still in force
- Document confirmed genuine by Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales
- Specific case: Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor covered up priest Michael Hill (convicted, 9 victims)

Architecture: Similar to Operation Mockingbird/MK-Ultra integration
Output: Evidence sources, claims, speakers, relationships
