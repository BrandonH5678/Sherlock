- Gaudet claimed "coincidence"

**September 27-28, 1963:** Mexico City
- Oswald (or someone impersonating him) visited Cuban Consulate
- CIA testing impulse camera on Cuban Consulate door (same days)
- Over 10 feet of 16mm film generated - **now "disappeared"**

**Late September 1963:** David Atlee Phillips

- HQ sent cable to JMWAVE: Phillips arriving October 9
- Two-day visit to Miami station
- **Joannides was director of propaganda operations at JMWAVE at this time**

### 6. David Atlee Phillips - CIA Officer

**Career:**
- **Position (1963):** Chief of CIA anti-Castro covert operations, Mexico City Station
- **Reputation:** Known as "world's greatest authority on Deception"
- **Early 1960s:** Worked at CIA HQ developing first disinformation operations against Fair Play for Cuba Committee
- **September 1963:** Promoted to Chief of Cuban Operations in Mexico City
- **Connection to Joannides:** Both worked anti-Castro propaganda, Phillips visited JMWAVE while Joannides ran propaganda there

**Testimony Issues:**
- **November 27, 1976:** Testified to HSCA he was in Mexico City when Oswald visited
- **TRUTH:** He was actually at CIA Headquarters and JMWAVE Miami (not Mexico)
- **August 24, 1978:** Confronted by HSCA researcher Dan Hardway
  - Became "extremely agitated"
  - Could not explain why misinformation linking Oswald to Castro came "predominantly from assets that he had handled personally"
  - Acknowledged back-channel communication methods existed

### 7. CIA Obstruction Operations

**Against Warren Commission (1964):**
- Never disclosed DRE funding/control
- Never disclosed Joannides's role
- **2014 Admission:** CIA official historian David Robarge admitted "benign cover-up"
- CIA determined "best truth" was Oswald acted alone
- DCI John McCone "complicit in keeping incendiary and diversionary issues off commission's agenda"

**Against Church Committee (1975):**
- Did not disclose DRE-CIA relationship
- Did not disclose Joannides

**Against HSCA (1977-1978):**
**ILLEGAL DOMESTIC COVERT OPERATION**

**The Operation:**
- CIA brought Joannides out of retirement (1978)
- Assigned as "liaison" to HSCA investigators
- **Actual role:** Obstruct investigation of his own 1963 operations
- CIA told HSCA: Joannides had "no connection with any area of inquiry"
- CIA told HSCA: No CIA officer assigned to DRE in 1963
- Joannides personally assured Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey these statements were true

**Methods:**
- May 1978: Joannides assigned to work with Dan Hardway and Eddie Lopez (HSCA researchers)
- Changed file access procedures immediately
- Slowed responses to file requests
- Began redacting files previously provided unexpurgated
- Tried to exclude Hardway and Lopez (researchers with most detailed knowledge)
- Provided false information about alias "Mr. Howard"
- Blocked research into:
  - Back-channel communications Mexico City-Miami
  - William Harvey's Office of Security files
  - Impulse camera photographs (Cuban Consulate)
  - Missing photo surveillance materials
  - David Atlee Phillips's propaganda connections

**CIA 2008 Admission (Under Oath):**
- Delores M. Nelson declaration (Morley v. CIA lawsuit)
- Admitted Joannides worked on "covert projects" only twice:
  1. **1962-1964:** JMWAVE operations (DRE)
  2. **1978-1979:** HSCA liaison
- **This means:** HSCA liaison work was classified as **covert operation**
- **Purpose:** Subvert Congressional investigation

**Testimony of G. Robert Blakey (HSCA Chief Counsel, under oath 2014):**
> "The credibility of the CIA is in doubt every time it speaks in whatever forum it does.... CIA falsely represented to me that Joannides had no connection with any area of inquiry being undertaken by the HSCA... Joannides lied to me about who he was and what he knew about the DRE and his role with it. CIA lied to me about knowing who Joannides was... The Agency knowingly and corruptly obstructed our investigation. In my professional opinion, Joannides and CIA were both guilty of obstructing proceedings before a Congressional committee... in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1505, a crime punishable by fine and up to 5 years imprisonment.... I no longer trust anything that the Agency has told us in regard to the assassination. It lied to the Warren Commission. It lied to the ARRB. It lied to the HSCA. In admitting that Joannides was employed in a covert capacity as liaison with the HSCA, it has admitted that it violated its charter and ran a domestic covert operation aimed at subverting the HSCA and its investigation."

**Against ARRB (1990s):**
- **January 20, 1998:** CIA told ARRB operational files for Dec 1962-April 1964 "appear to be 'missing'"
- **Explanation:** Policy differences led to reduced funding, reporting stopped
- **REALITY:** Joannides's own fitness reports show he was commended for excellent control of DRE throughout this period, budget was $2.4M, operations were successful
- **Assessment:** Files destroyed or hidden, not "missing"

**Against Federal Courts (2017):**
- Blakey, Hardway, Lopez lawsuit for HSCA obstruction documents
- CIA counsel claimed "undercover" only meant affiliation not publicly acknowledged
- **FALSE:** Joannides's CIA employment was publicly reported during Kampiles espionage trial (1978)
- Associated Press, UPI, Washington Post all reported Joannides as "28-year CIA employee"
- CIA's explanation not under oath (knew it was false)

### 8. Destroyed/Missing Evidence

**"Missing" Operational Files:**
- DRE operational files: December 1962 - April 1964
- Period covers: Joannides appointment through post-assassination
- CIA claimed "reporting simply stopped"
- Fitness reports prove this false

**Disappeared Photographs:**
- Over 10 feet of 16mm film from impulse camera
- Photographed Cuban Consulate door September 27-28, 1963
- Days Oswald visited (or was impersonated at) Cuban Consulate
- Film never produced to any investigation

**Untraced "Bulk Materials":**
- October 1, 1963 diplomatic pouch to Phillips
- Sent 3 days after Oswald's Cuban Consulate visits
- Back-channel method, deliberately untraceable
- Contents never disclosed

### 9. Congressional Response (2025)

**Task Force on Declassification:**
- **Chairwoman:** Rep. Anna Paulina Luna
- **Achievement:** Secured full George Joannides personnel file
- **Statement:** "We just learned definitively that the CIA has been lying for 62 years about the assassination of an American President"

**July 2025 Document Release:**
- 40 documents concerning George Joannides
- First time CIA acknowledged officer "came into contact" with Oswald before assassination
- Confirmed 62-year cover-up

### 10. Dan Hardway Testimony (May 20, 2025)

**Hardway Background:**
- HSCA researcher (1977-1978)
- Top-secret security clearance
- Investigated Oswald's Mexico City activities
- Investigated CIA knowledge/involvement in assassination

**Key Observations:**
- Provided unexpurgated CIA file access until May 1978
- Access curtailed when Joannides assigned as liaison
- Joannides specifically assigned to handle Hardway and Lopez
- Joannides obstructed every area of Hardway's research
- Hardway never knew in 1978 that Joannides had DRE connection
- CIA repeatedly assured HSCA: no CIA ties to DRE in 1963

**Hardway's Assessment:**
> "The CIA covered up information that could implicate them as an organization participating in a conspiracy because Oswald was not only under aggressive surveillance but was also being utilized in some capacity by them in active intelligence operations shortly before the assassination."

**Important Caveat:**
> "Even if CIA has been trying to cover up its operational use of Oswald in covert operations, that does not necessarily implicate them in the actual assassination. David Phillips and George Joannides may have been two of the most surprised people on the planet on November 22, 1963."

## Intelligence Assessment

### What We Know With High Confidence:

1. **CIA had operational contact with Oswald** through DRE (August 1963)
2. **George Joannides controlled DRE** at time of Oswald encounter
3. **DRE published first conspiracy theory** blaming Castro (day of assassination)
4. **CIA ran covert operation against HSCA** using Joannides (admitted under oath)
5. **CIA systematically lied** to every investigation for 62 years
6. **Critical evidence destroyed/missing** (operational files, photographs)
7. **David Atlee Phillips lied** about location during Oswald's Mexico visit
8. **Phillips and Joannides both promoted** in fall 1963 (reward for operations?)

### What Remains Unclear:

1. **Nature of CIA operations involving Oswald**
   - Was Oswald witting or unwitting participant?
   - What was operational objective?
   - Were New Orleans and Mexico City activities coordinated?

2. **CIA's actual role in assassination**
   - Operational use â‰  assassination involvement
   - Did operations go wrong?
   - Were Phillips/Joannides surprised on November 22?

3. **Extent of destroyed evidence**
   - What else was destroyed?
   - Who ordered destruction?
   - When were files destroyed?

4. **Phillips-Joannides coordination**
   - Did they work together in fall 1963?
   - What was in October 1, 1963 diplomatic pouch?
   - Purpose of Phillips's Miami visit October 9?

### CIA's Stated Motivation (2014 Admission):

**David Robarge (CIA Official Historian):**
> "Avoiding disclosures about covert actions that would circumstantially implicate CIA in conspiracy theories"

Not hiding Castro assassination plots (already disclosed 1975).
Hiding "covert operations against Cuba" that could implicate CIA.

**Why continue cover-up after 1975?**
If only hiding Castro plots, resistance should have ended when plots disclosed.
Continued obstruction suggests something else being hidden.

### Likely Scenario (Based on Available Evidence):

**CIA was running anti-Castro propaganda operations in 1963:**
- Used DRE as propaganda vehicle (Joannides)
- Used Phillips's assets for disinformation against Fair Play for Cuba Committee
- Operations coordinated between Mexico City and Miami stations
- Oswald utilized (wittingly or unwittingly) in these operations
- Operations designed to discredit pro-Castro groups
- New Orleans encounter created Oswald's public profile as communist
- Mexico City visit created additional intelligence connections

**Post-assassination:**
- DRE immediately published pro-Castro conspiracy theory
- CIA realized Oswald had been involved in their operations
- "Circumstantial implication" if operational use disclosed
- Systematic cover-up to prevent disclosure
- Destroyed evidence to prevent discovery

**Open Question:**
Did CIA's anti-Castro operations inadvertently create conditions for assassination?
Or was there deeper operational connection?

## Conclusions

The 2025 disclosure of George Joannides documents represents the CIA's first acknowledgment of operational contact with Lee Harvey Oswald before the JFK assassination. The evidence reveals:

**62-Year Systematic Cover-Up:**
- CIA lied to Warren Commission, Church Committee, HSCA, ARRB, and federal courts
- Ran illegal domestic covert operation to obstruct Congressional investigation
- Destroyed critical evidence
- Committed crimes in service of cover-up

**What CIA Was Hiding:**
- Operational use of Oswald in anti-Castro propaganda operations
- Coordination between Mexico City and Miami stations
- David Atlee Phillips and George Joannides's propaganda operations
- Evidence that could "circumstantially implicate CIA in conspiracy theories"

**What Remains Unknown:**
- Exact nature of CIA's operational use of Oswald
- Whether Oswald was witting participant
- CIA's knowledge before assassination
- Full extent of destroyed evidence

**Implications:**
- CIA violated charter by running domestic covert operation
- Multiple felonies committed to obstruct investigations
- Truth about JFK assassination still incomplete
- CIA credibility destroyed (per HSCA Chief Counsel)

**As Dan Hardway concluded:**
> "Government secrecy is a cancer eating at the foundations of our republic... unless we radically and completely reform the secrecy system, and the ease with which it is invoked and maintained, it will ultimately destroy us."
