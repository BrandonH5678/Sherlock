Integrate NDAA FY2024 (H.R.2670) UAP Legislative Outcome into Sherlock Evidence Database

CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE: The UAP Disclosure Act (S.Amdt.2610) was STRIPPED from the final
NDAA FY2024 (H.R.2670) during House-Senate conference negotiations in December 2023.

What was Removed:
- UAP Records Review Board with independent disclosure authority
- Eminent domain over recovered technologies and biological evidence
- Controlled Disclosure Campaign Plan
- Comprehensive non-human intelligence disclosure framework

What Remained:
- All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) continues
- Annual UAP reporting requirements (watered down from original)
- Limited whistleblower protections

Legislative Timeline:
- July 11, 2024: S.Amdt.2610 submitted (Rounds/Schumer)
- December 2023: Stripped from final NDAA during conference
- December 22, 2023: H.R.2670 enacted as Public Law 118-31 (WITHOUT UAP Disclosure Act)
