# NDAA FY2024 (H.R.2670) - UAP Disclosure Act Legislative Failure

**Bill**: H.R.2670 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024  
**Public Law**: 118-31  
**Enactment Date**: December 22, 2023  
**Critical Outcome**: **UAP Disclosure Act (S.Amdt.2610) STRIPPED from final version**  
**Source ID**: `HR2670_NDAA_FY2024_UAP`

---

## Executive Summary

**The UAP Disclosure Act of 2024 (S.Amdt.2610), sponsored by Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), was completely removed from the final NDAA FY2024 during House-Senate conference committee negotiations in December 2023.**

This represents a **critical legislative defeat** for UAP transparency efforts. Despite bipartisan Senate leadership support and $20M in authorized funding, the most significant provisions‚Äîeminent domain over recovered technologies and biological evidence, independent Review Board authority, and mandated private contractor disclosure‚Äîwere eliminated before final passage.

## What Was REMOVED (Critical Provisions Stripped)

### 1. **Eminent Domain Authority**
‚ùå Federal power to seize "recovered technologies of unknown origin" from private contractors  
‚ùå Federal power to seize "biological evidence of non-human intelligence"  
‚ùå Legal mechanism to compel Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman disclosure

### 2. **UAP Records Review Board**
‚ùå Independent agency with disclosure authority  
‚ùå Bypass of executive branch classification controls  
‚ùå Direct congressional reporting (not filtered through DoD/IC)  
‚ùå 60-day establishment requirement  
‚ùå $20M FY2025 dedicated funding

### 3. **Controlled Disclosure Campaign Plan**
‚ùå Structured timeline for public disclosure  
‚ùå Classified appendix for sensitive materials  
‚ùå Mandatory annual revision requirement

### 4. **Private Contractor Obligations**
‚ùå Mandatory disclosure of UAP-related materials  
‚ùå Transfer of materials to federal custody  
‚ùå Inventory and audit requirements

### 5. **Legislative Framework**
‚ùå JFK Records Act-style disclosure mechanism for UAP  
‚ùå Presumption of disclosure with limited exceptions  
‚ùå Independent review of postponement decisions

---

## What REMAINED (Watered-Down Provisions)

‚úÖ **AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office)** - continues under DoD control  
‚úÖ **Limited annual UAP reporting** - heavily redacted, executive branch controlled  
‚úÖ **Whistleblower protections** - reduced from original proposal  

**Net Effect**: Status quo maintained. DoD/IC retain full classification control.

## Opposition Analysis

### Who Killed the UAP Disclosure Act?

**1. Defense Contractors** (Primary opposition)
- **Target companies**: Lockheed Martin (Skunk Works), Raytheon Technologies, Boeing Phantom Works, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, SAIC/Leidos
- **Method**: Lobbying to House Armed Services Committee members
- **Motivation**: Protect proprietary control over recovered technologies and biological evidence
- **Success**: Eminent domain provisions completely removed

**2. Executive Branch / DoD / Intelligence Community**
- **Objective**: Maintain classification authority and gatekeeping power
- **Method**: Pressure on HASC to strip independent Review Board
- **Success**: Preserved executive control, prevented JFK Records Act-style bypass

**3. House Armed Services Committee (HASC)**
- **Role**: Conference committee gatekeeper
- **Action**: Negotiated removal of disclosure provisions
- **Justification**: (Likely) "National security concerns" / contractor lobbying

## Intelligence Implications

### üî¥ INVERSE CONFIRMATION

**Critical Analytical Question**: Why fight so hard to remove eminent domain if there's nothing to seize?

The **intensity and success of opposition** to eminent domain provisions provides **indirect confirmation** that:
1. **Recovered technologies exist in private contractor hands** (as S.Amdt.2610 assumed)
2. **Biological evidence exists** (why else strip biological evidence eminent domain?)
3. **Materials are valuable enough** to justify extensive lobbying campaigns
4. **Disclosure threat was real** (contractors don't fight hypotheticals this hard)

### Key Implications:

1. **Materials Existence Validated**: Contractor behavior suggests S.Amdt.2610's legislative assumptions were correct‚Äîrecovered technologies and biological evidence exist under private control

2. **Private Sector Control Confirmed**: Defense contractors successfully defended proprietary possession against federal eminent domain‚Äîunprecedented resistance

3. **Institutional Obstruction Documented**: Even bipartisan Senate leadership (Majority Leader Schumer + Armed Services Committee member Rounds) could not overcome MIC/deep state resistance

4. **Legislative Path Blocked**: JFK Records Act-style independent disclosure mechanism prevented‚Äîclassification gatekeeping preserved

5. **Status Quo Maintained**: Executive branch classification authority retained, AARO remains under DoD control (not independent)

2. ‚úÖ **Identify HASC conference members** who negotiated removal
3. ‚úÖ **Track contractor lobbying** (FARA, LDA disclosure filings 2023 Q3-Q4)
4. ‚úÖ **Investigate executive branch role** in conference negotiations
5. ‚úÖ **Correlate with Grusch timeline** (July 2023 testimony ‚Üí December 2023 strip)
6. ‚úÖ **Identify whistleblower impact** on legislative urgency and opposition response

## Analytical Conclusion

**The successful removal of the UAP Disclosure Act from NDAA FY2024 represents the most significant legislative defeat for transparency efforts in modern UAP history. However, the very intensity of opposition‚Äîparticularly from defense contractors targeted by eminent domain provisions‚Äîprovides indirect confirmation that the materials described in S.Amdt.2610 (recovered technologies and biological evidence of non-human intelligence) exist under private sector control.**

**The Military-Industrial Complex demonstrated its capacity to block even bipartisan Senate leadership, validating long-standing theories about institutional resistance to disclosure.**
