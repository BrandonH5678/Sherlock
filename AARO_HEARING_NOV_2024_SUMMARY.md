# Senate Armed Services AARO Hearing - Dr. Kosloski Testimony (Nov 19, 2024)

**Hearing**: Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities
**Date**: November 19, 2024, 4:30 PM
**Witness**: Dr. Jon T. Kosloski, Director, All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)
**Chair**: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)
**Ranking Member**: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA)
**Source ID**: `SASC_AARO_HEARING_20241119`

## Executive Summary

**Dr. Jon Kosloski's first public testimony as new AARO Director reveals significant transparency shift: 3 new unresolved anomalous cases publicly disclosed while high-profile cases (Puerto Rico, GOFAST, Mt. Etna) resolved as conventional phenomena.**

This hearing represents a critical data point in UAP disclosure trajectory - AARO maintains official position of "no extraterrestrial evidence" while simultaneously acknowledging genuinely unexplained cases with high-credibility witnesses (law enforcement, military personnel, pilots).

## Critical Intelligence Findings

### 1. **AARO Statistics (November 2024)**
- **Total reports**: 1,600+ UAP cases in holdings
- **Resolution rate**: Majority resolved as balloons, UAS (drones), satellites, or aircraft
- **Unresolved cases**: 3 newly disclosed anomalous incidents

### 2. **Official Position**
> "AARO has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology. We have not found any evidence that any U.S. government investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology."
>
> — Dr. Jon Kosloski, AARO Director

### 3. **Resolved Case Studies**

#### Puerto Rico 2013 (DHSnet Video)
- **Previous assessment**: Transmedium object entering/exiting water
- **AARO resolution**: Pair of aircraft in formation with thermal camera artifacts creating apparent water entry/exit effects
- **Intelligence note**: High-profile case resolution reduces credibility of transmedium phenomenon claims

#### GOFAST
- **Previous assessment**: Fast-moving object captured by naval aircraft
- **AARO resolution**: Optical illusion due to parallax effect - likely slow-moving balloon at lower altitude
- **Intelligence note**: Parallax explanation undermines apparent velocity, consistent with mundane object

#### Mt. Etna Volcano 2018 (Italy)
- **Previous assessment**: UAP near Italian military aircraft
- **AARO resolution**: Volcanic ash or debris from Mt. Etna eruption
- **Intelligence note**: Geographic context (active volcano) provides conventional explanation

### 4. **NEW Anomalous Cases (Unresolved)**

#### Case 1: Western US Law Enforcement Orange Orb
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Under AARO investigation

**Details**:
- **Witness**: Law enforcement officer (high credibility)
- **Location**: Western United States (specific location withheld)
- **Date**: 2024 (approximate)
- **Primary object**: Large orange orb floating at 400-500 feet altitude
- **Behavior sequence**:
  1. Orange orb observed floating stationary
  2. Black object emerged from orb and descended to ground
  3. Officer approached within 40-60 meters
  4. Black object rapidly accelerated vertically back into orb
  5. Orb rapidly departed area

**Anomalous characteristics**:
- Object emergence from larger object
- Rapid vertical acceleration (no visible propulsion)
- Coordinated behavior between two objects
- Close-range observation by trained law enforcement officer

**Intelligence implications**: Multi-object coordination, rapid acceleration without visible propulsion, high witness credibility

---

#### Case 2: Southeast US Metallic Cylinder
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Under AARO investigation

**Details**:
- **Witness**: Multiple trained observers at U.S. facility (military or government)
- **Location**: Southeastern United States facility
- **Date**: 2024 (approximate)
- **Object description**: Large metallic cylinder
- **Behavior**:
  1. Stationary hover for extended duration
  2. Instantaneous disappearance without visible propulsion or departure trajectory

**Anomalous characteristics**:
- Instantaneous disappearance (not gradual departure)
- No visible propulsion system
- No detectable departure trajectory
- Multiple credible witnesses (trained observers)

**Intelligence implications**: Instantaneous disappearance suggests technology beyond conventional capabilities, multiple witness corroboration increases credibility

---

#### Case 3: Aircraft-to-Aircraft Proximity Object
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Under AARO investigation

**Details**:
- **Witness**: Commercial or military pilots (highest credibility tier)
- **Location**: Airspace (location withheld)
- **Date**: 2024 (approximate)
- **Object description**: Small object flying between two parallel aircraft
- **Behavior**:
  - Maintained relative position between both aircraft despite forward motion
  - Flight characteristics inconsistent with known aircraft or drones
  - No radar signature detected

**Anomalous characteristics**:
- Position maintenance relative to moving aircraft (requires intelligent control)
- No radar return (stealth or non-metallic composition)
- Anomalous flight characteristics
- Pilot witnesses (trained aviation observers)

**Intelligence implications**: Relative position maintenance suggests intentional control, lack of radar signature indicates technological sophistication or unconventional composition

## Policy Announcements

### Public UAP Reporting Mechanism
- **Launch date**: Mid-2025
- **Purpose**: Allow civilian witnesses to submit UAP reports directly to AARO
- **Significance**: Expands AARO reporting beyond military/government channels

### Stigma Reduction Emphasis
Sen. Gillibrand: "The stigma surrounding UAP reporting continues to deter military personnel and civilians from coming forward. We must create an environment where witnesses feel safe reporting these phenomena without fear of ridicule or career consequences."

**Intelligence note**: Congressional focus on stigma reduction indicates ongoing witness reluctance, potentially suppressing data collection

---

## Intelligence Analysis

### Transparency Shift Assessment

**POSITIVE INDICATORS** (Increased transparency):
- Public disclosure of 3 unresolved anomalous cases with specific details
- New AARO Director willing to acknowledge unexplained phenomena publicly
- Congressional emphasis on stigma reduction and witness protection
- Public reporting mechanism launching 2025

**NEGATIVE INDICATORS** (Continued obfuscation):
- Resolution of high-profile cases (Puerto Rico, GOFAST) as conventional phenomena
- Official position maintains "no extraterrestrial evidence" despite unresolved cases
- Specific locations withheld for all 3 anomalous cases
- No discussion of Grusch allegations, recovered craft, or contractor programs

### Witness Credibility Analysis

**HIGH CREDIBILITY SOURCES**:
1. **Law enforcement officer** (Western US orb case) - Trained observer, professional background, close-range observation
2. **Military facility personnel** (Southeast US cylinder) - Multiple trained observers, government facility context
3. **Pilots** (aircraft proximity case) - Highest tier aviation observers, professional training

**Assessment**: All 3 unresolved cases feature high-credibility witnesses with professional training, reducing likelihood of misidentification

### Pattern Correlation

**Emerging UAP characteristics from unresolved cases**:
- **Rapid acceleration**: Western US orb case (vertical)
- **Instantaneous disappearance**: Southeast US cylinder case
- **No radar signature**: Aircraft proximity case
- **Intelligent behavior**: Object coordination (orb case), position maintenance (aircraft case)

**Historical consistency**: These characteristics align with historical UAP reports (e.g., Nimitz encounter rapid acceleration, disappearance patterns in Blue Book cases)

## Analytical Conclusions

### Key Takeaways

1. **INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH**: AARO demonstrates systematic case resolution methodology - high-profile cases resolved as conventional, genuinely anomalous cases acknowledged but not explained

2. **TRANSPARENCY CALIBRATION**: Selective disclosure strategy - resolve famous cases to demonstrate competence, disclose new unresolved cases to maintain credibility

3. **WITNESS PROTECTION FOCUS**: Congressional emphasis on stigma reduction suggests ongoing data suppression due to fear of ridicule/career consequences

4. **NO DISCLOSURE BREAKTHROUGH**: Despite 3 unresolved cases with anomalous characteristics, official position maintains "no extraterrestrial evidence"

5. **GRUSCH ALLEGATIONS IGNORED**: No discussion of recovered craft, contractor programs, or whistleblower claims from July 2023 testimony

### Intelligence Assessment

**The November 2024 AARO hearing represents incremental transparency improvement without fundamental disclosure breakthrough. Dr. Kosloski's testimony acknowledges genuinely unexplained phenomena while maintaining official denial of extraterrestrial technology. The 3 disclosed anomalous cases provide valuable data points for pattern analysis but do not advance understanding of UAP origin or capabilities.**

**The hearing confirms AARO's institutional role: resolve explicable cases, acknowledge unexplainable cases, maintain "no ET evidence" position - a calibrated approach that balances transparency demands with classification preservation.**

## Recommended Follow-Up Actions

1. ✅ **Monitor public reporting system rollout** (mid-2025) - assess data collection methodology and transparency
2. ✅ **Track resolution of 3 anomalous cases** - analyze AARO methodology when/if resolved
3. ✅ **Cross-reference case characteristics** with historical UAP patterns (rapid acceleration, instantaneous disappearance, no radar signature)
4. ✅ **Analyze witness testimony** - seek additional details from law enforcement officer, facility personnel, pilots
5. ✅ **Compare AARO resolution rate** with historical Blue Book statistics (70% resolved in Blue Book)
6. ✅ **Investigate geographic patterns** - Western US and Southeast US as recurring UAP activity regions
