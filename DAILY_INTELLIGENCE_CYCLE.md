## DETAILED PHASE BREAKDOWN

### PHASE 1: Strategic Analysis (Claude Code)

**Trigger:** Brandon activates Sherlock Targeting Officer mode

**Command:**
```bash
# From /home/johnny5/Sherlock directory
claude "Activate Sherlock Targeting Officer: Review all intelligence targets, analyze current evidence, identify gaps, and design 10 research packages - 5 for ChatGPT-5 (print sources only) and 5 for NightShift (audio/podcast processing). Use heavy reasoning."
```

**Claude Code Activities (Heavy Reasoning Mode):**

1. **Review All Intelligence Targets:**
   - Query Sherlock database for current target status
   - Read recent intelligence summaries and cross-reference analyses
   - Identify targets with status='new', 'in_progress', or knowledge gaps
   - Review POSS-I analysis, 1953 inflection point, and strategic priorities

2. **Evidence & Gap Analysis:**
   - For each priority target, assess:
     - Current evidence quality and quantity
     - Knowledge gaps preventing strategic conclusions
     - Connections to other targets (cross-reference opportunities)
     - Priority based on:
       * UAP phenomena understanding
       * Anti-gravity/propulsion research (Brown-Biefeld, zero-point)
       * Telepathy/psi-UAP interface
       * Control structures (media, financial, tech-intel fusion)

3. **Research Package Design:**
   - **ChatGPT-5 Packages (Print Sources):**
     - Focus on: historical documents, academic research, FOIA releases
     - Objectives: biographies, timelines, document analysis, network mapping
     - Sources: government archives, scientific papers, investigative journalism
     - Examples: Thomas Townsend Brown biography, 1953 programs timeline, Mockingbird history

   - **NightShift Packages (Audio/Podcast):**
     - Focus on: podcast interviews, conference presentations, witness testimony
     - Objectives: speaker identification, claim extraction, evidence validation
     - Sources: YouTube, podcast feeds, conference recordings
     - Examples: Thomas Townsend Brown interviews, remote viewing practitioners, UAP researchers

4. **Priority Assessment:**
   - Assign urgency based on:
     - Strategic value to overall mission
     - Cross-reference potential with existing intelligence
     - Time sensitivity of sources (aging witnesses, pending FOIA releases)
     - Resource requirements vs availability

**Output:** Research package designs with clear objectives, sources, deliverables

---

### PHASE 2: Package Distribution (Claude Code - Token Efficient)

**Command:**
```bash
claude "Switch to token-efficient mode. Push research packages to execution systems: ChatGPT-5 packages to CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md, NightShift packages to NightShift queue."
```

**Claude Code Activities (Token Efficient - Heuristic Mode):**

1. **ChatGPT-5 Package Posting:**
   - Append new packages to `/home/johnny5/Sherlock/CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md`
   - Format: Package ID, Priority, Objectives, Sources, Deliverables
   - Include execution instructions and completion criteria
   - Timestamp and sequence numbering

2. **NightShift Package Queuing:**
   - Use existing Sherlock Targeting Officer system
   - Push to NightShift queue database
   - Assign thermal safety requirements
   - Set execution windows (avoid business hours conflicts with Squirt)

3. **Confirmation:**
   - Report packages posted
   - Provide summary of what was queued where
   - Estimated completion timelines

**Output:** Packages ready for automated agent pickup

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### ChatGPT Not Picking Up Packages
1. Verify GitHub sync: `git pull origin main` then `git push origin main`
2. Check CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md formatting
3. Verify package status is 'QUEUED' not 'PENDING' or other
4. Check ChatGPT-5 automation schedule/credentials

### NightShift Not Processing
1. Check system temperature: `sensors`
2. Verify thermal safety thresholds not exceeded
3. Check queue database: `sqlite3 nightshift_queue.db "SELECT * FROM packages;"`
4. Review logs: `tail -100 /var/log/nightshift.log`

### Integration Failures
1. Verify file paths exist: `ls chatgpt_research_output/` and `ls nightshift_processing/`
2. Check database permissions: `ls -la evidence_database.db sherlock.db`
3. Review Claude Code error messages
4. Run integration manually with verbose logging

## NOTES

- **Audio processing still has kinks:** Focus ChatGPT packages on print sources until audio stack fully stable
- **Claude context limits:** Use token-efficient mode for routine tasks, heavy reasoning only for strategic analysis
- **GitHub as integration point:** Chosen because ChatGPT-5 can access public/private repos automatically
- **NightShift thermal safety:** Critical - don't override thermal limits or risk hardware damage
- **Research quality over quantity:** Better 3 high-quality packages than 10 mediocre ones

---

**System Status:** ACTIVE
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28
**Next Scheduled Activation:** Tomorrow morning when Brandon triggers
