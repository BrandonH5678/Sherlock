• UAP, formerly known as UFOs, are a long-standing global phenomenon,
which have not only been observed by professional engineers, scientists,
and astronomers, but have also been studied by them.
• There exist today a number of serious academic and private efforts
to scientifically study UAP using the equivalent of multi-messenger
astronomy, which involves a diverse array of scientific instrumentation.

Abstract
After decades of dismissal and secrecy, it has become clear that a significant
number of the world’s governments take Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea
Phenomena (UAP), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs),
seriously–—yet still seem to know little about them. As a result, these phe-
nomena are increasingly attracting the attention of scientists around the
world, some of whom have recently formed research efforts to monitor and
scientifically study UAP. In this paper, we review and summarize approxi-
mately 20 historical government studies dating from 1933 to the present (in
Scandinavia, WWII, US, Canada, France, Russia, China), several historical
private research studies (France, UK, US), and both recent and current sci-
entific research efforts (Ireland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, US). In doing so,
our objective is to clarify the existing global and historical scientific narrative
around UAP. Studies range from field station development and deployment
to the collection and analysis of witness reports from around the world. We
dispel the common misconception that UAPs are an American phenomenon
and show that UAP can be, and have been, scientifically investigated. Our
aim here is to enable future studies to draw on the great depth of prior
documented experience.

1. Introduction
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), which have been referred to as
Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena by the United States Congress
to emphasize their multi-media characteristics, are currently more simply
referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. While it is not widely
appreciated that UAP have been observed and reported for centuries [1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6], investigation into reports of unusual objects and light phenomena
in the sky has resulted in the identification, characterization, and scientific
understanding of a great number of aerial and astronomical phenomena, such
as planets, comets, asteroids and meteors, auroras, lenticular clouds, parhelia
(sundogs) and halo phenomena [7, 8, 9], and even St. Elmo’s fire [10], ball
lightning [11, 12], elves and sprites [13, 14, 15], as well as earthquake lights
[16, 17, 18]. Several of the latter examples have been recently considered
pseudoscientific [19], but are now recognized by the scientific community as
real phenomena worthy of study. To this day, there remains a residuum of
phenomena that continue to defy explanation.
The study of UAP suffers from two main difficulties.
First, the phe-
nomena are neither repeatable nor controllable. This makes scientific data
collection extremely difficult, since one must be resigned to setting up ob-
serving stations and waiting for events. In some ways this makes collect-
ing data on UAPs similar to collecting data on earthquakes, gravitational
waves, dark matter, or rare astronomical events, such as supernovae, ex-
cept that the observation of particular UAP of interest is potentially more
rare. The second difficulty is that it has often been asserted that witness
reports are not of anomalous phenomena and can be readily explained in
terms of well-understood natural phenomena, misidentifications, exaggera-
tions, and/or hoaxes; and therefore they are not worthy of serious scientific
study. This latter assertion has been widely held and promoted by the au-
thorities and the scientific community for over 70 years, thus preventing
study, discovery, and understanding; consequently, leaving us in a rather
disconcerting state of ignorance.
The problem and opportunity that we face today is that the situation has
changed dramatically. In December 2017, the New York Times (NYT) pub-
lished an article [20], which revealed that the US Defense Intelligence Agency
(DIA) had conducted a six-year covert program, the Advanced Aerospace
Threat Identification Program (AATIP), to study UAP. AATIP, which was
led by Luis Elizondo [21], focused on military-only encounters and existed
7

--- Page 9 ---
by operating under the more extensive Advanced Aerospace Weapon System
Application Program (AAWSAP), which was funded by $22 million secured
by Senators Reid, Inouye, and Stevens. The objective of AAWSAP was to
study the many aspects of UAP, which included the psychic and paranormal
correlates to UAP interactions [22, 23, 24, 25], while identifying “potential
breakthrough technology applications employed in future aerospace weapon
systems.”[26, 25] AAWSAP was managed by veteran intelligence analyst and
rocket expert James Lacatski [27, 24, 26, 25, 21]. At its peak, the effort em-
ployed 50 full-time investigators (far more than any other program), which
compiled the largest UFO data warehouse covering more than 200,000 cases.
George Knapp, in his statement to Congress [26], notes that the AAWSAP
Program produced more than 100 research papers on UAP, some of them
more than 100 pages long. He also notes that the first case investigated by
AAWSAP was the 2004 Nimitz TicTac event and that the report on the Tic-
Tac and its capabilities, written by the AAWSAP scientists and engineers,
was more than 140 pages long. None of these papers or reports have ever
been seen by Congress or the public [26].
In conjunction with the NYT article, Luis Elizondo worked to have several
infrared videos of UAP taken by the US Navy publicly released [28]. Later,
it was revealed that the US Navy has had ongoing [29], and at times daily
[30], encounters with UAP operating with impunity in restricted airspaces
and harassing naval pilots during military exercises and wartime operations
[31, 32, 33, 30].
In response, the United States Navy has changed its procedures for report-
ing such encounters [34], and enlisted Congress to take action [35, 36, 37, 38].
The Pentagon officially released three UAP videos in April 2020, confirming
that UAPs regularly operate in restricted airspace [39, 40, 41]. In June 2020,
the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to require the US Department of De-
fense and the US Intelligence Community to detect, track, compile, catalog,
and analyze information on UAPs through a program called the Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) [40].
In June 2021, the UAPTF presented its preliminary report to Congress,
reconfirming that these UAP are not of American origin and are unlikely
to come from any other country. The possibility was left open that they
are craft of potentially non-human origin. In response, US Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced the UAP amendment into the FY22 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA 2022) to establish a formal office to report
and respond to UAPs and provide the scientific capabilities needed to track
8

--- Page 10 ---
and share data, investigate sightings, and develop a response to this growing
security threat. This led to the legislation 50 U.S.C. §3373 (NDAA 2022
and NDAA 2023), which authorized the establishment of the All-Domain
Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which is directed to continue the duties
of the UAPTF. This includes “developing procedures to synchronize and stan-
dardize the collection, reporting, and analysis of incidents, including adverse
physiological effects, regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena across the
Department of Defense and the intelligence community”, “developing the pro-
cesses and procedures to ensure that such incidents from each component of
the Department and each element of the intelligence community are reported
and stored in an appropriate manner that allows for the integration of anal-
ysis of such information”, “evaluating links between unidentified anomalous
phenomena and adversarial foreign governments, other foreign governments,
or nonstate actors”, assessing possible threats, coordinating with other fed-
eral departments and agencies, “consulting with allies and partners of the
United States to better assess the nature and extent of unidentified anoma-
lous phenomena”, and “preparing reports for Congress, in both classified and
unclassified form” [42].
Although people are generally aware that there have been several pro-
grams run by the US government to study UFOs (Unidentified Flying Ob-
jects) and UAP, it is not generally known precisely what was done and, more
importantly, precisely how little was done. Moreover, it is generally believed
that serious scientists, academics, and especially astronomers do not believe
in the reality of UFOs, have not seen them, and certainly do not study them.
By going into some detail on efforts to study UAP in the late 1940s and
early 1950s, we learn that some prominent and serious scientists have been
involved, that they have witnessed UFOs of many types, and that they took
the matter quite seriously. Such details add context Sturrock’s (Sec. Ap-
pendix A.15) 1977 survey of members of the American Astronomical Society
[43] in which he found that out of the 1356 respondents, 23% stated that
UFOs should certainly be studied and 30% said that UFOs should proba-
bly be studied as opposed to 17% saying that UFOs should probably not be
studied and 3% that said that UFOs should certainly not be studied. More-
over, Sturrock found that 62 of the respondents had witnessed or obtained
an instrumental record of something that they could not explain, and that
of the respondent witnesses, 63% of them were night-sky observers.
This paper provides some background on UAP, followed by a detailed
exposition of previous and concurrent efforts to scientifically study UAP in
9

--- Page 11 ---
the expectation that a careful examination of these efforts will provide a
great deal of information relevant to current and future efforts. By focusing
on what scientific studies of UFOs have taken place, future studies can draw
on their experience, which includes both their successes and failures, and
can better equip themselves to select the best instruments, design the best
observation strategies, and identify the most promising locations to study.
Since many countries, research groups, and individuals have participated
in the scientific study of UAP for almost a century, there are several ways
in which the information in this article could be presented. Unfortunately,
there is no single presentation style that appears to be optimal. In some
situations, the chronology of events and efforts is central, suggesting that
a presentation based on chronology is obligatory. However, at other times,
once efforts became more focused, it appears to be best to separate out
efforts based on the nations, research groups, or the individuals involved.
As a result, the presentation in this paper is mixed to a great degree. At
some times, especially early on and during wartime, the interactions among
different nations dominated the efforts to understand these phenomena. For
this reason, the paper begins with a chronological, or historical, treatment
which, as efforts shift to become more isolated, gives way to a presentation
based on the nations, groups, or individuals involved. An appreciation of
both of these differing perspectives is necessary to understand the importance
and impact of efforts to study UAP in the past century.
2. What are UAP?
The acronym UAP can stand for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon
or Phenomena, although the A can also stand for Aerial or Aerospace. The
US Congress recently redefined the acronym UAP as the more descriptive
Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena [44, p.12], but this has since
migrated back to the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. The term aerospace
broadens the study of UAP to include the Earth’s atmosphere and outer
space; whereas the term undersea extends it to underwater and oceanic do-
mains. The importance of the multi-medium nature of UAPs is perhaps best
illustrated by the fact the successor to the UAP Task Force is the Pentagon’s
All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) [45], which was established
by the US Defense secretary to provide ongoing reports to Congress [46].
The term UAP refers to an object / phenomenon that cannot be imme-
diately recognized as prosaic, e.g. for aerial phenomena: human-made craft,
10

--- Page 12 ---
flying animals, or other well-known natural phenomena. “Unidentified” only
means that one does not know what something is—at least initially—until
additional analysis is possible. Since this is essentially a study of unknowns,
it could be more helpful to define a UAP in terms of the relevant characteris-
tics identified by the Pentagon’s AATIP Program. These characteristics are
known as The Five Observables: [27, 21]
1. Positive Lift without Flight Surfaces
2. Sudden/Instantaneous Acceleration
3. Hypersonic Velocity Without Signatures
4. Trans-Medium Travel
5. Low Observability or Cloaking.
In some close encounter scenarios, a sixth, albeit more disturbing, observable
is sometimes noted: [27, 21]
6. Biological Effects on Humans and Animals
While many UAP are ultimately identifiable and of mundane origin, some
remain unidentified. It is only this unidentified residuum that is of interest.
The degree of identification depends on the amount of detail that can be
provided by the various sensing methods used as well as the investigative
and scientific resources brought in.
There is little doubt that the majority of UAP are misidentifications, but
anywhere between 4-40% remain unidentified after careful investigations [47,
48, 49, 50], depending upon the sources and quality of the reports. Despite
this, there exist hard data that demonstrate unreasonably high speeds (above
Mach 40-60) and accelerations (hundreds to thousands of times g) [51, 52,
53, 54, 55, 56], without the corresponding sonic booms or fireballs; as well as
the emission of luminous power sometimes exceeding 100 MW (MegaWatts)
[57, 58]. Such observations represent cases of interest as they may require
more exotic explanations, such as hypotheses involving novel physics or at
least new engineering. However, more data are needed to characterize these
anomalous objects and definitively rule out observational errors [59, 60].
Many different phenomena are likely being included under the UAP um-
brella. While making an exhaustive list isn’t feasible, the possible prosaic
explanations of UAP include, but are not limited to:
11

1. human-made crafts, such as airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons,
satellites including space stations, like the International Space Station

contrary [19].

3. Government Efforts to Study UAP
This paper focuses on the historical efforts to scientifically study UAP.
Recent articles by Ailleris [63, 64], Stahlman [65], Villaroel & Krisciunas
[66], and Watters et al. [62] provide excellent summaries of such efforts. For
those interested in the history of the role of government in this rich and
involved topic, we recommend the detailed text by Swords et al. [67], as
the governmental aspects of our exposition are guided by their work. As
much of the relevant information exists in the gray (non-academic, non-peer-
reviewed) literature, it is important to summarize relevant details, if even to
dispel some of the common misconceptions about UAP.
Our exposition begins with its focus on chronology, as the early efforts
were international in scope. UAP studies have a rich history dating back to
antiquity [2, 4, 5, 1, 6], and include the airship wave of the late 1800s and
early 1900s [68, 69, 70].

We begin our chronological exposition with the so-called “ghost flyers”
sighted over Scandinavia in the 1930s. The reason for this is to emphasize
several points: that UAP are not a singular phenomenon, but are instead a
class of phenomena; that these phenomena did not all begin in 1947; and that
they are not a uniquely American phenomenon. For an historical overview,
see Eghigian [71].
3.1. Scandinavia
One of the earliest governmental efforts to study UAP began in late 1933
with a number of sightings of unknown aircraft in the skies above northern
Sweden, Norway, and Finland [67]. These were thought to be airplanes in-
volved in smuggling and, as such, had attracted the attention of Swedish
customs and the Swedish Air Force, which conducted surveillance. Together,
the unknown aircraft earned the monikers of “the Ghost Flyer”, “the Ghost
Machine”, and “The Flying X”. This activity peaked during the winter of
1933–1934, and by March 1934, 96 reports had been filed with the Swedish
military, 157 reports had been filed with the Finnish military, and 234 re-
ports had been filed with the Norwegian military; amounting to a total of
487 official reports [67].
The investigation concluded with the statement that “There have never
been any Ghost Flyers.” However, General Pontus Reutersw¨ard published
his own statement that “It could not be denied that a violation of our nation’s
air space has been going on” [72], for which he was heavily criticized. The
Swedish military later issued a final report in July 1935 concluding that 42
of the 487 reports were of actual aircraft violating the countries’ borders. As
a final assessment, it should be noted that very few of the sightings were
similar to modern UFO sightings [67].
Reports of unidentified aircraft over Scandinavia returned in the winter
of 1936–1937, prompting General Reutersw"ard to write to the Minister of
Defense. However, Social Democrat MP Elof Lindberg insisted that civil
experts should investigate the intrusions, rather than the military, which
was suspected of embellishing the reports for more resources [73]. However,
Lindberg’s demand for a commission was rejected by the Minister of Defence
as there had been few new facts and observations [67].
Scandanavian observations of unidentified aircraft, referred to as “ghost
rockets”, resumed in the late-1940s.
As a result, they had an impact on
American UFO investigations at that time [74].

3.2. World War II
Beginning in 1940, pilots from the British Royal Air Force (RAF) began
reporting observations of unidentified objects in darkness, as well as unknown
aircraft that would follow bombers without attacking them [75]. Intelligence
personnel initially believed that stress caused pilots to imagine these objects.
However, by 1942, there had been a sufficient number of reports that there
was some concern that these objects could be experimental devices being
tested by the Germans. There were several incidents in which RAF aircraft
opened fire on these unidentified objects with no effect [75].
During the last years of World War II, Allied pilots, in both the European
and Pacific theaters, began reporting unidentified aerial phenomena that in
daylight appeared to be small metallic, sometimes translucent, spheres; and
at night appeared to be spherical lights ranging from red to yellow in color
[76]. These objects, which earned the nickname “foo fighters”, would often
pace the airplanes, sometimes flying right off their wingtips. Reports were
made by pilots from the RAF, the Polish Division attached to the RAF [75],
the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the South African Air Force (SAAF)
[77], and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) [77, 75, 67, 78]. Again,
these were thought to be new Axis weapons [76].
Three prominent scientists were enlisted to look into the foo fighter re-
ports: H.P. Robertson (Caltech), Luis Alvarez (UC Berkeley), and David
Griggs (UCLA) [67]. Griggs was tasked by General Arnold with investigating
particular encounters. By the end of World War II, Griggs had determined
that there was something real to the observations in Europe and in the Pa-
cific and that they were not related to Japanese technology. In addition,
he learned that there were cases of aircraft electrical and engine interference
associated with foo fighters [67]. Although foo fighter sightings and encoun-
ters were reported to military units and were investigated by these three
scientists, it does not appear that the phenomenon was ever systematically
studied [79].
3.3. United States
3.3.1. UFOs and US Weather Bureau Station
In early 1947, there were a number of sightings made by US Weather
Bureau Station observers in Richmond, Virginia, that were of concern to
intelligence officials [67]. There were three occasions when after scientists
had launched a weather balloon and had begun to track and perform pibal
14

--- Page 16 ---
(pilot balloon) observations using theodolites (spotting telescopes) that they
observed metallic disc-shaped objects approaching the balloons.
On one
occasion, the balloon was at an altitude of 15000 feet, and the disc, elliptical
in shape with a flat bottom and a domed top, which appeared to be larger
than the balloon, approached the balloon and followed it for about 15 seconds
before speeding away. Another occurrence involved a balloon, at an altitude
of 27000 feet, that was similarly approached and followed by a metallic disc.
In all of these occasions, visibility was good. This series of events affected
Air Force officials, who were forced to acknowledge that the observations of
these discs were made by the best trained observers to distinguish objects in
the sky, using high-quality observation equipment in ideal conditions [67].
3.3.2. The Wave of 1947
UFOs entered the social consciousness of Americans during the summer
of 1947 when, during the period of a little more than a week in late June
and early July, there were a large number of prominent encounters with
UFOs in the United States (Fig. 1). The 1947 Wave has been summarized
in several texts [80][81], and has been the subject of Jan Aldrich’s Project
1947 [82]. In addition, the NICAP (National Investigations Committee on
Aerial Phenomena) Site, coordinated by Francis Ridge, has a comprehensive
chronological summary of the 1947 Wave [83].
The first prominent encounter was Pilot Kenneth Arnold’s sighting of a
long string of nine “circular type” objects near Mount Rainier in Washington
on June 24, 1947 [84] (Figure 2A), which was independently corroborated by
several other witnesses [81]. This event brought the term “flying saucer” into
our lexicon [85]. Arnold estimated the size of the objects to be about 100
feet in diameter, and he used the big sweep 24-hour clock on his instrument
panel to time their 1 minute 42 second passage from Mount Rainier to Mount
Adams, a distance of about 50 miles. Based on this, he estimated a speed of
about 1,760 miles an hour with an uncertainty of a couple hundred miles an
hour. This is significant because this estimated speed is almost three times
the world airspeed record of 623.62 mph at the time [86, p. 274].
Data compiled from newspaper articles by Ted Bloecher [80] reveal that
the last week in June and the first week in July 1947 saw an increase in the
daily average number of sightings from about 7.20 ± 6.86 (consistent with
a Poisson distribution) to a nearly Gaussian peak of 155 sightings on July
5th and 162 sightings on July 6th, which represents a significant and rapid
increase in the number of daily sightings of about 22 standard deviations

above the June mean (Figure 1). Although it is not clear how much of this
effect was sociological, there were numerous reliable sightings made by pilots
and military personnel, as well as law enforcement officers and academics,
presented and discussed by Bloecher [80]. We conclude this section by sum-
marizing a number of these sightings.
On July 3rd, two Navy Chief Petty Officers, Robert L, Jackson and
William Baker, were at the Naval Station in San Diego, California, where
they observed three disc-shaped objects over the Pacific Ocean. The objects
flew in from the West, circled, and then headed back to sea.
On July 4th, Yeoman Frank Ryman, of the US Coast Guard, photographed
a disc as it flew over Lake City, Washington. Also on July 4th, Irving C. Allen,
Chief of Airports Operations and Management in the 7th Region for the Civil
Aeronautics Administration, and his passenger, watched for five minutes, a
disc-like object fly north across his flight path near Moscow, Idaho, as they
were flying from Coeur d’Alene to Lewistown, Idaho.
United Airlines Flight Trip 105 Captain Emil J. Smith and First Officer
Ralph Stevens, along with Flight Attendant Miss Marty Morrow, watched a
loose formation of nine flying discs at the same level as their plane as they
17

--- Page 19 ---
approached their cruising altitude of 7000 feet over Emmett, Idaho, on July
4th [80]. Three weeks later, on July 28th, Captain Charles F. Gibian and First
Officer Jack Harvey, flying the same United Airlines Flight Trip, observed an
unidentified object at about 9000 feet altitude “weaving,” as if “it were going
through choppy air.”
On July 5th, TWA pilot Captain John L. Dobberteen and copilot Frank
Corwin made observations of a spinning propeller-like object moving at an
estimated speed of 200 mph over Neapolis, Ohio.
On July 7th around 4:00 pm in Phoenix, Arizona, William Albert Rhodes
observed and photographed an elliptical-shaped object, which appears to be
similar to the objects observed by Kenneth Arnold (Figure 2B). The object,
which made a sound similar to that of an approaching jet, spiraled down from
5000 feet to 2000 feet and then ascended at a 45◦angle with an estimated
speed of 400 to 600 miles per hour.
On July 8th, there were three independent events that involved the ob-
servation of objects of disc or sphere shape over Muroc Air Base, California.
One of these events was witnessed by test pilot Major J. C. Wise as he pre-
pared to perform a test of the XP-84 jet. The object was spherical in shape
and was flying against the wind at an estimated speed of at least 200 mph.
Also, on July 8th, more than 100 Navy men at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, watched
a long silvery oblong-shaped object fly westward toward Honolulu.
At 1:00pm on July 8th on Catalina Island, off the coast of Laguna Beach
California, three veterans of the US Army Air Corps, Bob Jung, Kenneth
Johnson and Alvio Russo, along with hundreds of other witnesses, observed
six discs, in a formation of two groups of three, approaching the island from
the direction of Los Angeles to the northeast, flying directly over the city
of Avalon, and disappearing over the East Peak to the south of Avalon Bay.
The discs flew at high speed, estimated by two of the veterans to be about
850 miles per hour. Jung, an aerial photographer, was able to photograph
one of the discs. [87, 80]
3.3.3. The US Government’s Response
Documents, not intended for the public, have revealed that US officials
were seriously concerned about this sudden increase in UFO sightings [79]:
This “flying saucer” situation is not all imaginary or seeing too
much in natural phenomena. Something really is flying around.
- July 30, 1947 [88]
18

--- Page 20 ---
The phenomena reported is something real and not visionary or
fictitious.
- Sept. 23, 1947 [89]
It is the considered opinion of some elements that the object [sic]
may in fact represent an interplanetary craft of some kind.
- Oct. 28 1947 [90]
By the end of December 1947 it was ordered that USAF Air Materiel Com-
mand at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base initiate Project SIGN to establish
the nature of these UFOs [91].
3.3.4. Project SIGN
Project SIGN, which was established in January 1948, was the first UFO
investigation of the USAF, which involved both the Air Force Office of In-
telligence (AFOIN) and the Air Materiel Command (AMC) of the USAF at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. AFOIN consisted of two distinct execu-
tive branches, the Air Force Office of Air Intelligence (AFOAI) and the Air
Force Office of Intelligence Requirements (AFOIR), which had two different
perspectives on the flying disc phenomenon [67]. AFOIR was closer to the
problem and having met witnesses and familiarized themselves with first-
hand reports, they were convinced of the physical reality of the phenomenon
[67]. AFOAI took a more hands-off approach and focused on the intelligence
aspects of the problem, which led to concern about a potential Soviet threat
[67]. Meanwhile, the AMC at Wright-Patterson AFB was better equipped
to incorporate Project SIGN as a special project in which engineers and
technical support personnel worked toward a physical understanding of the
phenomenon [67]. Naturally, this led to two very different interpretations of
the situation.
Project SIGN did not collect their own data on UFOs. Instead, they col-
lected several hundred reports from both governmental and non-governmental
sources [79]. During the course of the project in 1948, several cases were re-
ported that seemed to defy straightforward explanation. For example, on 7
May 1948, witnesses in Memphis, Tennessee, watched an estimated 50 or 60
metallic objects racing across the sky mainly in a straight line, but exhibited
some unusual zigzagging [92, 67]. Several months later, on 24 July, East-
ern Airlines Flight 576, having left Houston Texas, was over Montgomery,
Alabama, when Captain C.S. Chiles and Captain John B. Whitted spotted
