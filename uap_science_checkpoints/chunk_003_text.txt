with an array of scientific instruments: a gravimeter to measure the Earth’s
gravity, a magnetometer to detect magnetic field variations, and even an
ionospheric reactor to study atmospheric conditions. This facility, dubbed
the “Canadian Flying Saucer Observatory” by the press, became a hotspot
for media attention. The observatory aimed to measure any magnetic, radio
noise, or even gravitational anomalies associated with UAP sightings, in the
hope of collecting concrete scientific evidence.
Smith’s work was ambitious, but his unconventional research attracted
skepticism and mounting pressure from within the Department of Transport.
Although he maintained that his work adhered to rigorous scientific princi-
ples, his growing emphasis on the extraterrestrial hypothesis raised eyebrows
among his colleagues. The credibility of the project was further strained as
the media coverage increased, leading to public interest and a flood of in-
quiries to the department. This negative publicity only heightened tensions
between Smith and his superiors, who had begun to regret supporting such
a controversial endeavor.
Despite Smith’s dedication and the meticulous experiments conducted at
Shirley Bay, Project Magnet was officially terminated in mid-1954. The De-
partment of Transport cited adverse publicity and a perception that Smith’s
investigations had drifted outside the scope of its mandate. However, Smith’s
efforts left a lasting impact, highlighting the complexities of governmental
engagement with the UFO phenomenon and setting the stage for ongoing
debates about the nature of UFOs and the pursuit of scientific truth.
Smith’s story serves as a testament to the challenges faced by pioneers
trying to bring legitimacy to the study of UAP and the delicate balance
between scientific inquiry and institutional support. Project Magnet stands
as a historical case of how curiosity and hope for technological advancement
met the bureaucratic realities of a skeptical world, laying the groundwork for
future discussions on the trust gap between governments and the public in
the search for extraterrestrial life [143].
3.4.2. Sky Canada Project
The Sky Canada Project, led by the Office of the Chief Science Advisor
(OCSA) of Canada, was launched in the Fall of 2022 to study and evaluate
how UAP sightings are managed in Canada [144]. A preliminary report was
published in January 2025 [145] with a full report expected to be publsihed
in March 2025.
Sky Canada works to collect information from relevant federal depart-
40

--- Page 2 ---
ments and agencies, experts, non-government organizations, and a number of
countries, including the G7 nations and members of the Five Eyes. These fed-
eral departments include the Canadian Coast Guard, the Canadian Nuclear
Safety Commission, the Canadian Space Agency, the Department of National
Defence (DND), the Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC),
GEIPAN (France), the Library and Archives Canada (LAC), the Meteorolog-
ical Service of Canada (MSC) at Environment and Climate Change Canada
(ECCC), MUFON Canada, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC),
NAV CANADA, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (RCMP), Sˆuret´e du Qu´ebec (SQ), and Transport Canada
[145].
The preliminary report notes that Canadians report 600 to 1,000 sightings
annually, with one in four respondents claiming to have personally witnessed
a UAP in their lifetime. Sky Canada recommends that 1) data on UAPs
be made publicly available to support research, 2) periodic surveys be con-
ducted to gauge public perception and to improve services, 3) participatory
science programs should be developed to enable volunteer involvement in
UAP studies, and 4) publicly accessible digital tools should be made available
to aid in data collection. Furthermore, Sky Canada recommends developing
“partnerships with international entities dedicated to UAPs, such as AARO
and NASA (U.S.A.), GEIPAN (France) and SEFAA (Chile), to share data,
methodologies and best practices in UAP research and investigation” [144].
The Sky Canada preliminary report concludes by stating: [145]
Adopting a science-based, collaborative approach will help ad-
dress public concerns, demystify UAPs, and potentially reveal
valuable insights into aerial phenomena that are currently unex-
plained.
3.5. France
3.5.1. 1940-1968: Airspace Vulnerability and Scientific Interest
The sightings of “ghost rockets” in Scandinavia had also captured the
attention of the French. On May 13, 1946, the then president of the pro-
visional government of the Republic, Georges Bidault [146] addressed the
highest authorities of French Defense. Not only was this document transmit-
ted to the highest Defense authorities, showing the interest in the subject,
but its recovery by the American military services also shows that the USA
was interested in the French position. The document reads:
41

--- Page 3 ---
...
faced with the result of numerous observations made, and
in particular those of 9 and 10 July (more than 250 in Sweden
— a number which appears quite high and which must include
engines counted several times) it is impossible to doubt that they
are projectiles. The Swedish and Finnish staff are now absolutely
convinced; the certain proof which would constitute an almost
intact projectile has nevertheless not yet been found.
The favored hypothesis at the time was that these “ghost rockets” were ex-
amples of Soviet rocket fire. The characteristics of these devices, reported by
numerous witnesses and difficult to explain prosaically by the Scandinavian
authorities, were of interest [147] to the Bureau Scientifique de l’Arm´ee de
l’Air (Air Force Scientific Bureau) [148, 149]. which was created in 1945. The
Bureau was called upon in 1951 to set up a file on UFO sightings following
a wave of reports that same year.
Meanwhile, echoes of the summer of 1947 wave of UFO sightings in the
USA had reached the French press [150]. As soon as the press picked up
on the 1947 wave in the United States, and then on the waves of 1952 and
1954, a number of players from civil society, the armed forces [151, 152] and
sciences became closely interested in the subject. They set up UAP research
associations, such as the International Commission of Scientific Inquiry in
1951, later renamed Ouranos, created by Marc Thirouin, with the help of
another important figure on the subject: the writer Henry-Ren´e Guieu, who
became head of its investigative section [153]. These groups structured the
French landscape of UAP studies.
While the aim of this section is to present French initiatives on the subject,
we can see that from the outset, UAP-related issues were perceived and shown
to be international. The documents will mainly be restricted to France, but
these international interactions must be taken into account.
It should be noted that, in the 1950s, the subject was dealt with in line
with the zeitgeist. Thus, in the early years, the subject was first studied by
proponents of euhemerism (myths are accounts of actual events), of which the
aforementioned Marc Thirouin was also a figure during the interwar period.
It wasn’t until the late 1960s that a split took place between those motivated
by a more scientific approach and others led by a more literary and historical
approach, but generating rejection because of its proximity to esotericism.
Jean-Ren´e (Jimmy) Guieu played a role in popularizing the subject. A
prolific writer, he only published two works on the subject of UFOs [154,
42

--- Page 4 ---
155], but used witness observation reports as a source of inspiration for his
science fiction works, a possible explanation for the connections often made in
sociology between testimony and fiction work [156]. A journalist, he hosted
numerous sections on the subject on RMC and France 3 — one of the state
channels.
Aim´e Michel is one of the key figures in the birth of the study of UAP
in France. Working for the national radio station since 1946, he later joined
the Ouranos group. He published two reference works on the subject in 1954
and 1958 [157, 158]. In Myst´erieux Objets C´elestes (Mysterious Celestial
Objects) [158], he mentions that although he had heard of the phantom
rockets of 1946 and the Mount Rainier sighting in 1947, it was the discovery
of a file on unusual phenomena reported by stations, shown by the deputy
director of the weather service’s technical services, engineer Robert Clausse,
that convinced him around 1950. He then researched who was dealing with
the subject in France and discovered articles by Captain Cl´erouin, head of
the French Air Force intelligence service, and Lieutenant Plantier, already
mentioned above. Through the former, he met Jean Latappy, who had begun
work on the subject before the Second World War. Latappy proposed an
initial classification system based on the object’s appearance and behavior.
Each class was associated with a specific symbol, and these were then placed
on a map of France locating the observation. Thus, the parade of maps and
symbols made it possible to model UFO sightings in France.
Following his discussions with these pioneers of the subject, Aim´e Michel
wrote his first book. Readers then contacted him, including the astronomer
Pierre Gu´erin and Professor R´emy Chauvin. In his second book, he describes
the influence of Charles Fort concerning possible contacts with the “Others”
and Edward Ruppelt, who allowed him and his network to understand the
concept of “wave” during the increase in the number of cases in 1954. Aim´e
Michel describes how direct witnesses push those close to them, including
filmmaker Jean Cocteau and General Chassin, commander of NATO Air
Defense in the central European sector.
From the study of the testimonies, Michel postulated that objects, what-
ever they may be, emit high-intensity magnetic fields. He also noted that
automatic astronomical instruments seem to capture inexplicable luminous
objects. He noted that some reports appear to align geographically.
At the beginning of the 1960s, he joined another informal research group:
the Invisible College, along with Jacques Vall´ee, Pierre Gu´erin, R´emy Chau-
vin, Olivier de Costa Beauregard, and also Claude Poher (Appendix A.13).
43

--- Page 5 ---
The nickname was coined by J Allen Hynek, “in reference to the secretive
group of ‘natural philosophers’ who fought against the established dogmas
of the church in the mid-seventeenth century to acquire knowledge through
experimental investigation.” [159]
Jacques Vall´ee is certainly the most emblematic personality in the study
of UAP, both in France and abroad. From 1962, he tried to find models
corresponding to the statistics of UFO sightings. His research was published
in 1966 in “Les ph´enom`enes insolites de l’Espace” with Janine Vall´ee [160].
He also developed a UAP classification method that included both effects on
the environment and witnesses.
The combination of these two sets bears a striking resemblance to the
findings of research carried out by other groups, sometimes more than half
a century later [21], and in other countries. The authors also propose to
generalize the use of statistical analysis and to install observation stations
capable of recording the polarizations and the spectrum of light collected by
photographing these objects. In the event that the phenomenon is too rare
for it to be effective, they propose sending automatic probes to search for
traces of civilizations in the solar system.
In 1962, after the end of the pioneering organizations interested in the
subject, including Jacques Baccard’s Scientific Research Center, created in
1949, and the Ouranos Commission [153], the engineer Rene Fou´er´e and his
wife established the Groupement d’Etudes des Ph´enom`enes A´eriens (Aerial
Phenomena Study Group), or GEPA, one of the first organizations devoted
to the subject, which brought together the military and scientists.
Thus, from 1962, the landscape for the study of UAP in France was es-
tablished. Military observations were transmitted to army offices. In society,
citizen investigators took up the problem to answer questions from the public
and inventory cases [161], and sometimes came together as ufological asso-
ciations. Military personnel and scientists interested in the subject would
also mingle with these organizations. These organizations were sometimes
public, going so far as to obtain the title of press organ, or private, allowing
the exchange of information without fear of being mocked.
3.5.2. 1968-1977: Creation of a Public Structure and Private Organizations
Between 1962 and 1968, numerous figures on the subject emerged, mul-
tiplying the number of structures and research groups. According to several
sources [162, 163, 148], General De Gaulle gave his approval to the creation
of an investigation group, concerned by a case of mass observation in 1954
44

--- Page 6 ---
in Tananarive [164], on the island of Madagascar. The creation of the in-
vestigation group was ultimately aborted in 1968, but would remain the
first attempt on the part of the executive to have a structure specifically
responsible for the subject. The same year, Air Force Colonel George Marey
described the type of investigation carried out by the prospective-air office
[165], responsible for investigating espionage attempts by rival actors.
Since 1952, the gendarmes (French military police) have also been par-
ticipating in these field investigations, the most notable of which concerns
the case of Valensole, in 1965 [166]. In 1974, journalist Jean-Claude Bour-
ret interviewed Minister of the Armed Forces Robert Galley on the subject
of UFOs. Jean-Claude Bourret is a figure in French journalism and had a
column on the national radio France Inter on the same subject, which was
quoted by Robert Galley during the interview [167].
The impact that Jean-Claude Bourret had on media coverage was sig-
nificant; even today, he is one of the rare public figures on the subject in
France. He notes [49] moreover that the aversion of certain French scientists
to UFOs is directly linked to the publication by the United States of the
Condon report (see Sec. 3.3.7).
In this interview between Jean-Claude Bourret and Robert Galley, the
Minister of the Armed Forces declared [167]:
We have had a certain number of radar observations. In partic-
ular, in the 1950s, we had an inexplicable and still unexplained
radar echo lasting for ten minutes.
Asked about the close encounters between French citizens and the pilots of
these machines, Robert Galley declared [167]:
I must say that if your listeners could see the accumulation of
information coming from the air gendarmerie, the mobile gen-
darmerie, the gendarmerie in charge of territorial investigations
which was transmitted to the CNES by us, it is actually quite
disturbing.
These actions continued in the 1970s with the Bureau Prospectives et
Etudes de l’Etat Major de l’Arm´ee de l’Air (French Air Force Forward Stud-
ies Office) or BPE/EMAA, which was already responsible for processing ob-
servations made by pilots at the end of the second world war [49].
The engineer Claude Poher (see Section Appendix A.13), quoted in the
interview by the Minister of the Armed Forces, is another of the great figures
45

--- Page 7 ---
who structured the field of scientific research on UFOs. A member of the
Coll`ege Invisible and GEPA, in 1969 he was appointed Director of the Fus´ees-
Sonde Division at CNES.
Unlike other national space agencies, CNES is a public establishment of
an industrial and commercial nature. France is the fourth largest space power
in the world in terms of budget, behind the United States, China and Japan,
and ahead of Russia, Germany and Italy. Created by General De Gaulle in
1961, CNES made France the third country to launch a satellite into space in
1965, after the USSR and the United States. This agency is based on three
different ministries, the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and
Digital Sovereignty, the Ministry of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of
Higher Education and Research.
Claude Poher published in the journal “Les Lumi`eres Dans La Nuit” a
statistical study of UFO sightings in 1972 [168]. Created in 1958 by Raymond
Veillith, this journal was one of the main platforms allowing researchers,
witnesses, scientists, and soldiers to publish their work. It still exists today
under the direction of Jean-Louis Lagneau.
According to Thomas Wiroth [163], Poher stated that according to his
study:
UFO sightings were a worldwide phenomenon; the phenomenon
presented exactly the properties expected for actually observed
manifestations; the features described were distinct from any-
thing known.
Another interesting event that occurred in 1974 was the dissemination of
recommendations by members of the Institut des Hautes ´Etudes de D´efense
Nationale (IHEDN) proposing the creation of a UFO study office. These first
recommendations, disseminated under the direction of General Blanchard
[148], were confirmed by a report in 1977, disseminated by the Association
of Auditors, under the leadership of General Richard [169][170, p.300].
3.5.3. 1977-2024: Evolution of the study of UAP
General Richard’s willingness to advance the topic, along with a renewed
public interest due to a wave of observations at the beginning of the 1970s, as
well as the work of the members of the Invisible College, constituted a spark:
in 1977, CNES general manager Yves Sillard created Groupe d’´Etudes et
d’Informations sur les Ph´enom`enes A´erospatiaux Non-identifi´es (the Uniden-
tified Aerospace Phenomena Study Group, or GEPAN, later referred to as
46

--- Page 8 ---
GEIPAN), to be led by Claude Poher. A scientific council, responsible for
overseeing GEPAN, was associated with it, chaired by the president of CNES.
Between 1977 and 1978, Claude Poher presented 2 studies, totaling nearly a
thousand pages.
Following the departure of Claude Poher in 1978, Alain Esterle took the
helm of GEPAN. Under his direction, the organization published numerous
technical documents [171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179], information
notes [180, 181, 182] and working documents [183, 184, 185]. Alain Esterle
left the group in 1983 and was replaced by Jean-Jacques Velasco, who led
it for 20 years. Under his direction, GEPAN was renamed the Atmospheric
Reentry Phenomena Expertise Service (SEPRA) in 1988 [186]. The structure
operated with a network of investigators making it possible to meet witnesses
after they have given testimony to the gendarmerie, and after an initial field
investigation by the gendarmes. The GEPAN and then SEPRA investigators
had specific equipment, including the SIMOVNI developed in part by Mr.
Velasco, making it possible to simulate in the field what the witness observed,
as well as an inclinometer to measure the elevation of the object in relation
to the visual field of the witness. Although GEPAN enjoyed a certain level
of independence [187], CNES decided to withdraw the organization’s ability
to conduct further scientific studies, after some failed to achieve their goals
[188, p.98–99]. It seemed that all GEPAN could do now was collect data.
The scientific programs were now ordered by the CNES Scientific Programs
Committee.
However, even though GEPAN / SEPRA could not finance
them, it could help other research actions [189].
In February 1995, General Denis Letty organized a conference at the Air
School on unidentified aerospace phenomena.
At the same time, he con-
tacted General Bernard Norlain, then director of IHEDN, and obtained his
support in the creation of a “Comit´e des Etudes Approfondies” (Committee
of In-depth Studies) (COMETA), on the subject of UAP. In 1999, the re-
sult of the work of this committee formed under the associative regime was
published as a report after validation by the authorities. Bringing together
military personnel, defense engineers and scientists, the COMETA associa-
tion delivered its work under the title “UFOs and Defense, what should we
prepare for” [49]. Based on case analyses by French and international pilots,
but also observations by witnesses, including cases of close encounters, the
report highlights national security, but also technological and societal issues.
The COMETA Report notably lists technologies that could explain ma-
chine performance, witness paralysis, stopping of engines of land vehicles,
47

--- Page 9 ---
propulsion systems that allow movement on an interstellar scale - noting
that new technologies could be developed in the future that would better
explain the observed kinetics of these devices [49].
The report addresses the different hypotheses, considering, for example,
attempts to explain observations such as collective hallucinations as unsci-
entific. It also lists the possibilities of technological breakthroughs by rival
nations, attempts at disinformation, holographic image emissions, and un-
known natural phenomena as not sufficient to explain the performance of
UAPs and being unrealistic. The document discusses the hypothesis of an
extraterrestrial origin at length, considering it as the least improbable [49].
According to Yves Couprie and Egon Kragel [190], the COMETA report
was submitted by Jean-Jacques Velasco to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in
1999. On 16 July, it was broadcast in a special edition of the weekly magazine
VSD with a circulation of 70,000 copies, thanks to the journalist Bernard
Thouanel [191].
In 1998, Jacques Vall´ee (Sec. Appendix A.17) wrote an article on the
composition of materials supposedly found near UAP [192].
In February 2000, CNES decided to remove the monitoring of atmospheric
re-entries from the mission of SEPRA (renamed for the occasion Service
d’Expertise des Ph´enom`enes Rares A´erospatiaux), whose mission was to re-
focus on collecting information on UAP sightings and building up a database
of eyewitness accounts.
CNES then decided to follow the recommendations of an external audit
of SEPRA, the LOUANGE [193] report, commissioned by the CNES Presi-
dency in 2001, and to reorganize SEPRA by creating the Groupe d’Etudes et
d’Informations sur les Ph´enom`enes A´erospatiaux Non identifi´es (Group for
Studies and Information on Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena) or GEIPAN
in September 2005, while a Comit´e de Pilotage des Etudes et de l’Information
sur les Ph´enom`enes A´erospatiaux Non identifi´es (Steering Committee for
Studies and Information on Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena) or COPEIPAN
was set up to succeed the GEPAN and SEPRA Scientific Committees. GEIPAN’s
mission is to collect, analyze, archive, and publish aerospace observations
and phenomena not explained by witnesses. The information mission gives
GEIPAN a new central dimension.
Under the impetus of its first director, Jacques Patenet, GEIPAN launched
a vast project to sort and digitize its archives, as well as a methodological
overhaul aimed at presenting the public with complete and coherent files.
In 2009, with 30% of the investigation files ready for publication on the
48

--- Page 10 ---
GEIPAN [194] website created for the occasion, the group was authorized to
open its archives to the public, an unprecedented initiative that marked a
major step forward in the transparency and accessibility of data on uniden-
tified aerospace phenomena. This groundbreaking decision quickly attracted
worldwide media attention, testifying to the widespread interest in UFOs
and UAP.
In the early days, the department enjoyed good support from CNES man-
agement and most of the employees had a positive view of it. However, public
attitudes varied, from opposition to strong interest, and even increased de-
mand for in-depth investigation of the UFO phenomenon.
During this period, GEIPAN continued to evolve, organizing the manage-
ment of testimonies and improving procedures for collecting them by tele-
phone or through statements made in the gendarmerie and later by email.
The service continues to be structured, replacing the Inspecteurs de Premier
Niveau (First Level Inspectors) (IPN) with a corps of volunteer investigators
drawn from the general public. Recruitment, training, and operating rules
were rapidly implemented, resulting in a national network of about 15 inves-
tigators who could be commissioned by GEIPAN to carry out investigations.
Building on the initiatives taken by GEPAN, CNES / GEPAN has devel-
oped and formalized strong partnerships with local authorities to facilitate
field investigations and obtain accurate and reliable information. The part-
nerships initiated from the outset with the Gendarmerie Nationale have been
extended to include several national institutions such as METEOFRANCE,
the Centre National des Op´erations A´eriennes (National Air Operations Cen-
ter) or NOA of the French Air Force, the Centre Op´erationnel de la Surveil-
lance de l’Espace (Space Surveillance Operations Center) or COSE at the
CNES, the DGAC for domestic air traffic, the CNRS for observations re-
lated to astronomy, lightning and plasmas, as well as university experts in
scientific, cognitive and clinical psychology.
GEIPAN has its own investigative tools, such as image processing soft-
ware to authenticate photographs and videos supplied by witnesses [195], and
interfacing algorithms dedicated to extracting information from these media.
GEIPAN also coordinates a network of multidisciplinary national experts
in the fields of aviation, aerospace, and psychology, who are regularly con-
sulted in difficult investigations, or to give their opinion on the classification
to be assigned to a case after investigation.
This classification of UAP after investigation has been slightly revised
since the inception of GEPAN, and has remained stable since 2005:
49

--- Page 11 ---
1. phenomenon perfectly identified
2. probably identified but lacking evidence
3. phenomenon not identified due to lack of data
4. phenomenon not identified after investigation
GEIPAN is considered an expert service of CNES, which reports to the
CNES Technique et Num´erique executive department. The general public’s
interest in UFOs and UAP makes it a showcase for the media. The early
integration of the CNES Communications Department into COPEIPAN has
boosted GEIPAN’s visibility, while ensuring that the media authorized to
communicate with the group are properly channeled. The media have also
been encouraged to turn to the website and its informative and educational
features, which have gradually reinforced the dissemination of rigorous and
transparent information on UAP. GEIPAN also provides information to the
general public and students through public conferences.
In April 2007, Vall´ee published an update to his case classification method
[196]. Based on his work in 1962 [197], it is the result of nearly four decades
of research on the extraction of usable information from witness testimony.
Unlike other methods of classification, which focus on the witness, the one
presented in this article seeks to categorize the behavior of the object per-
ceived by the witness.
In June 2007, the French Aeronautical and Astronautical Association
(3AF) created a UAP commission under the chairmanship of Alain Boudier.
The commission was structured under the name Sigma in May 2008, and
produced its first internal report in 2010. The chairmanship changed in 2013
to Luc Dini [198].
In 2014, GEIPAN organized a workshop [199] on methods and tools that
are likely to improve the Collection and Analysis of Information on Unidenti-
fied Aerospace Phenomena (CAIPAN). During the 8th and 9th of July, ufolo-
gists and scientists exchanged their expertise, both astronomical and psycho-
logical. The subjects presented were, among others, survey methodologies
among air personnel and air traffic operators, statistical studies based on ob-
servation reports, witness interview techniques, the use of sound data, video
expertise, the establishment of databases, surveillance of the sky and space
by the Air Force, the use of sky observation cameras within the FRIPON
network, and the capabilities of detections of UAP.
50

In 2021, the 3AF-Sigma 2 technical commission published a report [198]
of 377 pages of technical analyzes on UAP cases, and has since organized
annual conferences on the subject. More information about this group and
their work will be presented later in the article.
In March 2021, the Defense Historical Service announced the opening of
the UFO archives [200], made up of archives of investigations carried out by
the Gendarmerie between 1954 and 1983.
In 2022, CNES organized a second CAIPAN conference [201]. This con-
ference covered two themes: the methods and surveys on the one hand, and
on the other hand, the tools and knowledge [202]. During this conference,
Jacques Vall´ee proposed new avenues of study, including the examination
of debris recovered using multiplexed ion ray imaging technology developed
by Garry Nolan [203], but also the use of artificial intelligence to search for
matches in UAP case databases.
On the 10th of March 2023, The Debrief published the reply of a spokeswoman
from ONERA (Office nationale d’´etudes et de recherches a´erospatiales) (Na-
tional Office for Aerospace Studies and Research) to a question on the subject
of UAPs: [204]
As far as ONERA is concerned, its research work is focused on
identified aerial phenomena for defense purposes essentially...
We have programs to develop instruments for this purpose, which
could potentially pick up unidentified phenomena or detect ‘things’
moving in unexpected orbits, but that would be the end of it.
On June 9, 2023, Jean-Claude Bourret and physicist Patrick Marquet
published a book: Les Ovnis voyagent dans le temps (“UFOs travel in time”)
in which the authors support a hypothesis explaining the anomalies observed
by UAP witnesses through the use of distortions of space-time. In this book
interview, the reader finds a bibliography of scientific articles supporting this
possibility [205].
On the 11th of October 2023, responding to a citizen question via the
Agora relay platform, the Minister Delegate in charge of Industry Roland
Lescure declared: [206]
We have approximately 700 declarations per year of these UAP.
Of these 700, there are 97(%) which are very well identified, it
could be a satellite, it could be a reflection of the moon, it could
51

--- Page 13 ---
be, frankly, someone who had a few drinks and declared some-
thing that didn’t exist.
There are 3% who are not identified
today. They are - they are not UFOs, they are not Martians but
they are phenomena which are classified for reasons of national
defense. So let me reassure you: we are completely transparent.
The minister’s office then informed the Parisien journalist Ga¨el Lombart that
the minister made a mistake during his declarations. The perfectly identified
cases represent 24.5% of cases, and not 97%, and very abnormal cases are
not under Defense secrecy [207].
On the 2nd of July 2024, IHEDN organized a round table on UAP to
provide an overview of its international developments and its challenges [208].
The Sentinel Lab initiative plans to launch, in January 2025, a mobile
UAP detection platform, which has been in the testing phase since the sum-
mer of 2024 [209]. As we have seen, the desire to record data scientifically
goes back to the Second World War, and while the deployment of mobile
investigation platforms has a long tradition in the territory, the development
of new surveillance capabilities using wide-field cameras (high sensitivity and
high image refresh rate at a lower cost) represents an interesting and impor-
tant development.
This brief chronology only reflects a fraction of the work that has been
carried out in France.
3.6. Russia
In an interesting symmetry with the US, the scientific study of UAPs
in the Soviet Union and then in Russia went through a series of advances
and setbacks, depending on the political considerations of the state and the
scientific consensus of the time.
According to cosmologist Felix Ziegel [210], one of the pillars [211] of the
scientific study of UAPs, it began in 1946 with the proposal by engineer A. P.
Kasantzev that the Tunguska event in 1908 could correspond to the crash of
an extraterrestrial craft, triggering fact-finding missions to the site.
In 1956, Yu. A. Fomin, senior lecturer at the Department of Automation
at the Moscow Technological Institute of the Food Industry, began collecting
the first reports of sightings over Soviet territory.
However, in 1960, the
Moscow Planetarium told civilians asking about their UAP sightings that the
phenomenon they observed was “apparently related to one of the experiments
52

--- Page 14 ---
carried out to measure the density of the atmosphere at high altitudes, with
the launch of a sodium cloud”.
In 1961, in an article in the national daily Pravda written by the physi-
cist Lev Artsimovich, he declared that UAPs “exist to the same extent as
reflections on water or a rainbow in the sky, i.e. only as a play of light in the
atmosphere. Everything else is either self- deception or a deliberate falsifi-
cation of facts.” As a result, Fomin was expelled from the All-Union Society
for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, which put the
brakes on the study of UAPs.
In 1967, B. P. Konstantinov requested and received reports of UAP sight-
ings from the Minister of Civil Aviation, E.F. Loginov, to accompany the pub-
lication of a book on the habitability of space. The media coverage rekindled
interest in UAPs, and a UAP study group was established, electing Major
General P. A. Stolyarov as its head. Its aim was to collect reports of sight-
ings of UAPs and to create a public committee to study UAPs. This was
achieved the same year with the support of the authorities. Following an
appeal to the public, an influx of reports arrived, but shortly afterwards the
president of their supervisory authority decided to dissolve the UAP study
structure. A few days later, speakers from the Moscow planetarium gave pre-
sentations explaining that UAPs were nonexistent and that the study groups
on the subject were dangerous. It should be noted that at the same time,
the United States was also trying to find out what the USSR knew about
UAPs [212].
Following a request by Lev Arsimovich, the Department of General and
Applied Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences published a resolution
condemning the study of UAPs. This cycle of efforts by individuals to es-
tablish a scientific study structure with the backing of the authorities, the
setting up of a group, and its subsequent dissolution, often by state action,
was to be repeated many times.
According to the 2021 Sigma 2 Report [149], Russian studies over the
period 1950–1990 show a peak in research in the period 1970–1986 with a
civilian program (SETKA-AN) for the study of phenomena called ‘anoma-
lies’ and a military program (SETKA-MO) for defense work concerning the
sensitivity of defense systems to these phenomena or the use of research for
the purpose of military technological fallout.
The Russian-American agreement concluded in 1971 [213] relating to the
risks of accidental launching of nuclear weapons specifies both the detection of
unidentified (unknown) objects and the risks induced by possible interference
53

--- Page 15 ---
affecting missile launch facilities.
Without mentioning the causes of such phenomena, this demonstrates
a mutual concern with regard to risks that have nothing to do with the
risks of characterized intrusion into the airspace or of a preventive strike of
the installations, but rather with the need to put in place alert and mutual
information procedures (“red telephone”) from the beginning of the 1970s.
This concerns the risks affecting the launch bases, which could lead to firing
missiles caused by a misinterpretation linked to the presence of an unknown
object, or by the effect of interference.
The initial meeting of the civil SETKA-AN and SETKA-MO research
programs (one on physics, the other on military effects and applications)
took place on October 18, 1978 at the Academy of Sciences with its main
protagonists, among which were:
• The Izmiran Institute, at the Academy of Sciences, in charge of terres-
trial magnetism and the diffusion of radio waves: Prof. Vladimir Vasi-
lyevich Migulin and head of research Yury Victorovich Platov, Izmiran
being the leading institute for the academy of sciences.
• The Institute of Space Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences,
represented by Prof. Georgiy Stepanovich Narimanov and Inna Gen-
nadyevna Petrovskaya.
• The Moscow Institute of Technology, represented by Prof. Rem Gen-
nadiyevich Varlamov.
• The Department of General Physics and Astronomy of the USSR Academy
of Sciences, represented by Prof. A. N. Makarov.
• The Schternberg State Institute of Astronomy represented by Prof. Lev
Mironovich Gindilis, who can be found cited in the archives of GEIPAN
[181].
• The NI-22 or 67947 military research unit: M. M. Victor Petrovich
Balashov and Vladimir Ivanovich Volga.
• The air defense forces represented by Colonel Zaytsev.
Among the military works, the role of the Soviet navy seems to have been
important in view of the very numerous observations of flying or aquatic ob-
jects (nicknamed Quakers) brought together by their reinforced observation
network between 1977 and 1980.

The Soviet Navy was also involved from 1977 (07/10/1977) in research
on abnormal phenomena. It issued guidelines for investigating and gathering
information on UFOs to fleets and flotillas, by order of Admiral Smironov,
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy.
This was then extended on January
20, 1978, by Vice Admiral Ivanov, Chief of the Intelligence Directorate of
the Navy, who gave instructions to the Oceanographic Commission, with
the assistance of V. G. Ajaja. According to the KGB, mention is made of
cases of material collection with particular properties on certain sites such as
Dalnegorsk. This work seems to have stopped or to have been greatly slowed
down after 1990.
In 1979, a study [214] carried out by the PR 473 Space Research Institute,
part of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and written by L.M. Gindilis, L.G.
Petrovskaya and D.A. Menkov, presented a statistical study of UFO sightings.
The study concludes: [214]
A certain portion of the observations may be due to various tech-
nical experiments in the atmosphere and space near the Earth, to
observations of space technology objects in particular. However
the kinematic characteristics exclude the possibility of such an
explanation for at least one third of the cases.
Meetings on UAP events between Russian and Chinese experts in the
early 1990s were mentioned in CIA archives on UAP published in 2016 and
the holding of academic conferences around 1994.
Observation on kinematics has since been reinforced by other strange
characteristics such as electromagnetic emissions at certain frequencies of
artificial origin. They have been noted in the past by the Americans and by
the Russians in their respective reports.
In 2023, the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics announced the
launch of a UAP study program [215]. The Institute was founded in 1953
and was involved in “national projects of space exploration, atomic and ther-
monuclear application” [216]. Witnesses of unusual objects or phenomena
were asked to send videos and photos. Some papers related to UAP research
can also be found in scientific journals [217].
3.7. China
The studies of UAP have been quite similar in China. Depending on the
period, the associations collecting testimonies, directly under the authority
55

--- Page 17 ---
of the party or the military forces, grew in importance until the authorities
decided to dissolve them. Culturally, folklore can often be related to UAP
observations [218], and, much like Russia, the media is particularly quick to
cover national and international news on the subject as long as it does not
involve national security.
One notable exception occurred in 2015. A Chinese initiative, supported
by Russia and led by Jin Fin, was created, which brought together an inter-
national panel of ufologists. The initiative was financed by China and relayed
in the West by Roberto Pinotti and Donald Schmitt. Its first event was the
“Five Continent Forum”, in Moscow, in 2018. Its goal was the creation of an
international working group on UAP with national representatives and the
signing of an oath of allegiance to the organization stating that the “UAP
Phenomenon was real and that we were dealing with an extraterrestrial /
non-human intelligence.” Shortly after, Chinese commitments failed to be
achieved and the group continued its work independently under the name
International Coalition for Extraterrestrial Research (ICER) [219].
Another exception occurred in 2021. Shortly before the release of the US
Department of Defense 2021 UAP report, in the English-language Chinese
media, the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Stephen Chen wrote [220]:
According to Wuhan-based researcher Chen Li from the Air Force
Early Warning Academy, human analysts have been overwhelmed
in recent years by the rapidly mounting sighting reports from a
wide range of military and civilian sources across the country.
...
The PLA’s [(People’s Liberation Army)] task force dedicated to
the unknown objects increasingly relies on AI technology to ana-
lyze its data, according to Chen’s report, which is in line with sev-
eral other military studies published in domestic journals, most
recently in August last year.
...
According to Chen and his colleagues, the PLA has a three-tier
reporting system to handle unknown aerial objects.
The base
level, which includes military radar stations, air force pilots, po-
lice stations, weather stations, and Chinese Academy of Sciences
observatories, is responsible for gathering as much raw data as
possible.
The information is processed in mid-tier by the PLA’s regional
56

--- Page 18 ---
military command which conducts preliminary analysis and trans-
fers the data to a national database.
With the help of AI, PLA headquarters assigns a “threat index”
to each object based on its behaviour, frequency of occurrence,
aerodynamic design, radioactivity, possible make and materials,
along with any other information.
The AI can pull together other information which may help de-
termine an object’s purpose.
Interestingly, the author adds: [220]
The only officially confirmed UFO sighting in China occurred
on a military airbase in Cangzhou, Hebei province, on October
19, 1998. According to a report in the Hebei Daily, the official
newspaper of the province that neighbors Beijing, two military
jets were ordered to intercept a low-flying object that suddenly
appeared above the airbase.
The object looked like a “short-legged mushroom”, with two beams
of light shooting down from its belly. When the jets approached,
the object climbed with “ghostlike” speed to an altitude of more
than 20,000 meters, before disappearing from radar and visual
contact.
Since then, SCMP [221, 222, 223] has steadily covered the topic, showing
not only China’s interest in UAPs but also a desire to communicate to the
international audience that it is interested in this topic. The February 2023
“balloons” event in the United States only rekindled that interest [224, 225,
226].
3.8. Governmental Studies Summary
It really is not possible to describe all the efforts to study UAP in the
last century in this paper. We covered some of the most prominent, influen-
tial, and representative examples, such as those efforts made by the United
States, France, at least one effort in Canada, as well as having summarized
the activities of Russia and China. As a result, we neglected to discuss the
efforts made by the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, as well as
Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea, and Central and South American
countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Columbia, Mexico,
57

--- Page 19 ---
Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, several of whom have governments that have
dedicated themselves to an unrivaled level of transparency on this topic. For
example, open official efforts such as Centro de Identificaci´on Aeroespacial
(CIAE) in Argentina, which was created in 2019 after a restructuring of the
earlier Comisi´on de Estudio de Fen´omenos Aeroespaciales (CEFAE), have
been in place for more than a decade [227]. Similarly, the Chilean govern-
ment has been extremely transparent, having both declassified and released
documents [228] and military videos [229].
There are many details that the above presentation has omitted, in part
because there is much that is not known. For example, whereas many of the
early US government programs to study UAP were focused on compiling and
investigating sightings, there is some evidence that there were government-
supported activities to develop new methods to scientifically collect inde-
pendent data on UFOs. For example, an article from a 1952 issue of Look
magazine notes that under the direction of the Air Force Air Technical Intel-
ligence Command, a UCLA physicist was developing a camera system using
a diffraction grating to capture both imagery and spectra of UFOs, and that
this camera system was to be used in conjunction with cine-theodolites, radar
detection systems, and Navy sonar systems to collect hard scientific data on
UFOs that would be presented to a board of scientists for study [230].
The mention of Navy sonar systems in the 1952 Look magazine article,
above, suggests that as early as the 1950s, there was an awareness of the
submarine nature of UFOs long before transmedium capabilities were noted
by the AATIP program. This neglected aspect of UFOs had been indicated
and discussed by some UFOlogists [231, 232, 233, 6] and emphasized in the
recent paper by Admiral Gallaudet [234]. This important characteristic of
UAPs is summarized in Section 6.
4. UAP and Nuclear Weapons
One of the most disturbing and important aspects of UAP is the fact
that they have been observed for decades to be active around nuclear power
plants and nuclear weapon sites. Robert Hastings has been studying UFO
incursions at nuclear sites for more than fifty years (since 1973), having
interviewed over 150 former and retired military personnel involved in such
cases in addition to having identified and acquired supporting declassified
and FOIAed (Freedom of Information Act) government documents from the
U.S. Air Force, FBI, and CIA, which confirm the relationship between UFOs
58

--- Page 20 ---
and nuclear weapons.
Hasting’s research [235] provides important details
that highlight the extent and significance of these events.
For example, a January 1949 memorandum to Edgar J. Hoover, the Di-
rector of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), titled “Protection
of Vital Installations” [237] is focused on “unidentified aircraft” observed at
vital military facilities:
At Weekly Intelligence Conferences of G-2, OHI, OSI, and F.B.I.,
in the Fourth Army Area, Officers of the G-2, Fourth Army have
discussed the matter of “ ‘Unidentified Aircraft’ or ‘Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena’ otherwise known as ‘Flying Discs’, ‘Flying
Saucers’, and ‘Balls of Fire’. This matter is considered top secret
by Intelligence Officers of both the Army and the Air Forces.
· · ·
During the past two months various sightings of unexplained phe-
nomena have been reported in the vicinity of the A.E.C. [Atomic
Energy Commission] Installation at Los Alamos, New Mexico,
where these phenomena now appear to be concentrated. During
December 1948 on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 11th, 13[th], 14th, 20th,
and 25th sightings of unexplained phenomena were made near Los
Alamos by Special Agents of the Office of Special Investigation;
Airline Pilots; Military Pilots; Los Alamos Security Inspectors,
and private citizens. On January 6, 1949, another similar object
was sighted in the same area.
Details also exist on sightings at Hanford Nuclear Works (Fig. 4 A). In
early 1945, Clarence R. “Bud” Clem, a Lieutenant Junior Grade in the US
Naval Reserves, was an F6F Hellcat pilot and was deployed to Naval Air
Station (NAS) Pasco, Washington, for ground support training in March
1945. Lt. Clem writes [235, pp.43-44]:
One night, shortly after the evening meal . . . We learned that
an unidentified ‘bogey’ was over the Hanford Ordinance Works,
according to the radar operator located on an auxiliary field just
across the Columbia River from Hanford reservation.
We had been instructed upon arrival [at NAS Pasco] that the
Hanford Ordinance Works was Top Secret and no flights over any
part were permitted. . . . The duty officer stated that something
was in the sky over the area and wanted someone to investigate. A
