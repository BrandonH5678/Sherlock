McDonald gave a lecture on “The Problem of UFOs” to the American
Meteorological Society in Washington, D.C. in October 1966.
McDonald
estimated that only about 1% of UFOs were unknowns, and that the UFOs
of interest were described by the “credible and trained observer as machine-
like ‘craft’ which remained unidentified in spite of careful investigation.”
McDonald found support to research UFOS from the Office of Naval Re-
search in 1967, where he was to officially study the idea that some UFOs were
misidentified clouds. During his studies, McDonald was able to examine the
files of Project Blue Book at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. He concluded
that the Air Force was mishandling UFO evidence.
The Secretary General of the United Nations, U Thant, also supported
McDonald’s studies, and he arranged for McDonald to speak to the United
Nations’ Outer Space Affairs Group on June 7, 1967. During the address, Mc-
Donald declared that “There is no sensible alternative to the utterly shocking
hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial probes” [461].
On 29 July 1968, McDonald addressed the House Committee on Science
and Astronautics of the United States Congress on the topic of UFOs. In his
statement, McDonald notes [462]
the scientific world at large is in for a shock when it becomes
aware of the astonishing nature of the UFO phenomenon and its
bewildering complexity. I make that terse comment well aware
that it invites easy ridicule; but intellectual honesty demands
that I make clear that my two years’ study convinces me that in
the UFO problem lie scientific and technological questions that
will challenge the ability of the world’s outstanding scientists to
explain - as soon as they start examining the facts.
[...]
the
scientific community [...] has been casually ignoring as nonsense
a matter of extraordinary scientific importance.
McDonald wrote detailed criticisms of the Condon report [463], and was
especially disturbed by the fact that Condon, in his introduction, stated
that all UFOs could be explained as hoaxes or misidentified prosaic objects,
despite the fact that the report has classified 30% of the cases investigated
as “unknown”. In a letter to Condon, dated June 6, 1969, McDonald wrote:
[464, Appendix 16-B, p.574]
Enclosed are copies of a number of summaries of recent talks
in which I criticized your Report. Your conclusions do not at all
140

--- Page 2 ---
seem to be supported by the Reports content. The contents of the
Report argue need for much more careful examination of the UFO
problem. And this in spite of what I must view as many gross
inadequacies of scientific aspects of the investigations you headed.
I am unable to understand how you approached this task as you
did. Your Philadelphia and Irvine talks indicate you must have
no awareness of the weakness of the position you have developed.
I am in process of preparing discussions of many features of the
Report which seem to me to attest to that weakness.
In giving the Academy such a Report, I believe you did science
a direct disservice. That the Academy processes could lead to
endorsement is disturbing.
In 1969 McDonald presented his influential lecture “Science in default:
Twenty-two years of inadequate UFO investigations” to a UFO Symposium
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science [128]. An audio
recording of McDonald’s presentation can be heard here [129].
McDonald was deeply concerned about society and spent hundreds of
hours researching the effects of the proposed supersonic transport (SST)
emissions on the upper atmosphere. He concluded that SST posed a great
danger in that it would adversely affect the ozone layer of the Earth, increas-
ing the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the surface and increasing the
occurrence of skin cancer [458]. In 1970, at a US congressional hearing on
the development of supersonic transport (SST), McDonald testified that the
SST could potentially harm the Earth’s ozone layer. Congressman Silvio O.
Conte of Massachusetts, who supported the SST because of the participation
of businesses in his district, discredited McDonald by referring to his UFO
research stating that anyone who “believes in little green men” was, in his
opinion, not a credible witness”.
A representative list of his articles on UFOs follows: [462, 465, 466, 467,

Appendix A.11. Dr. Donald Menzel, Harvard College Observatory
Dr. Donald Menzel (1901-1976) was born in Colorado. At the age of 16,
Menzel enrolled in the University of Denver to study chemistry and stayed
on for a master’s degree in chemistry and mathematics, which he received in
1921. The solar eclipse of 8 June 1918 and the eruption of Nova Aquilae in
1918 stimulated his interest in astronomy. He found a position as a summer
141

--- Page 3 ---
research assistant to Harlow Shapley at the Harvard College Observatory.
Menzel then received a Ph.D. in astronomy from Princeton University in
1924, and in 1926 he was appointed assistant professor at Lick Observatory of
the University of California in San Jose, California; later moving to Harvard
University.
His colleague at Harvard, Dr. Dorrit Hoffleit, recalls that one of his first
actions was asking his secretary to destroy a third of the astronomical pho-
tographic plates (sight unseen) [468]. This resulted in their permanent loss
from the record, which was referred to as the “Menzel Gap”. It is impor-
tant to note that the Menzel Gap adversely affects the modern efforts by Dr.
Beatriz Villaroel and her VASCO Project (see 7.1.6) to identify astronomical
transients and possibly connect some of them with UAP [339].
Menzel was a prominent skeptic concerning UFOs. He authored or co-
authored three popular books debunking UFOs: Flying Saucers - Myth -
Truth - History [469], The World of Flying Saucers [470], and The UFO
Enigma [471], all of which argued that UFOs are misidentifications of prosaic
phenomena, along with several relevant papers [472, 473, 474, 475].
Appendix A.12. Dr. Richard Niemtzow, Brooks Air Force Base
Richard Charles Niemtzow was born on 18 April 1942 in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. He received his medical degree, specializing in radiation on-
cology, in 1976 from the Universit´e de Montpellier Facult´e de M´edecine,
Montpellier, France, his Ph.D. in biological sciences in 1985 from Pacific
Western University, and his Master’s Degree in Public Health in 1992 from
the Medical College of Wisconsin. He studied acupuncture at the University
of California at Los Angeles Medical School.
Dr. Niemtzow attended the United States Air Force School of Aerospace
Medicine, and became a Flight Surgeon, class of 891003, Brooks Air Force
Base, Texas.
He introduced innovative techniques of pain control using
acupuncture, and is best known as the developer of battlefield acupuncture
for pain relief [476].
Apart from his work with the Air Force, Dr.
Niemtzow investigated
numerous cases of witness injuries after UFO encounters, working with John
Schuessler of MUFON and civilian teams. He established Project UFOMD,
which consisted of a network of medical doctors to intensively study UFO
related injury cases. His publications include: [477, 478, 479, 480, 481]

Appendix A.13. Dr. Claude Poher, CNES
Dr. Claude Poher, who holds a PhD in Astrophysics, began his career as
an electrical engineer, and was an instructor with Air France, and astronomi-
cal researcher with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).
Poher served for 30 years as a scientist in Space Research and Aeronautics
with the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES), contributing to scien-
tific experiments in space at the time of the NASA lunar explorations, using
the various USSR and US space stations and various planetary exploration
missions.
Poher has organized numerous international congresses of astronautics
and advanced technical studies concerning the future feasibility of inter-
stellar travel.
In 1977, Poher created and directed (1977-79) the Groupe
d’Etudes des Ph´enom`enes A´erospatiaux Non-identifi´es (GEPAN) in Toulouse
as a government-funded research group that examines unidentified aerospace
phenomena (UFOs or “OVNIs” in French). Now known as “GEIPAN”, the
group remains the only civilian, unclassified research organization devoted
to the compilation, investigation and analysis of UFO reports.
In 1996, Poher retired from CNES to pursue personal research into the
physics of gravitation. Experiments based on his theory has recently allowed
him to develop a series of patented devices with potential applications in
various fields. Dr. Poher has been awarded the French National Order of
Merit Medal, the AAAF Astronautical Prize, and the CNES Medal.
Among Dr.
Poher’s influential works are these two papers investigat-
ing patterns in UFO sightings [168, 482], and this paper detailing the UFO
encounters at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota USA in 1968 [53],
which was critical in assisting to establish the high accelerations and speeds
of UFOs/UAP noted earlier in 1954 by German rocketry pioneer Hermann
Oberth [51], and by Coumbe [56], and Knuth, Powell, and Reali [55], as
summarized by Knuth [107].
Appendix A.14. Dr. Harley Rutledge, Southeast Missouri State Univ.
Physicist Dr. Harley D. Rutledge of Southeast Missouri State Univer-
sity, together with his PhD students, carried out a monitoring campaign
called Project Identification in Piedmont, Missouri USA from 1973-1981
[483], where a recurrent light phenomenon occurred. Rutledge’s team used
magnetometers, telescopes, and optical and radio spectrometers to obtain
measurements. These measurements were collected together with detailed
reports from numerous witnesses. This was the first scientific-instrumented
143

--- Page 5 ---
attempt to study these phenomena, and while the researchers were driven
and determined, they could not develop the type of systematic or automated
approach that one would aspire to today due to the lack of computer technol-
ogy. Despite this, Project Identification was somewhat successful, especially
since it both inspired and informed subsequent scientific studies of the phe-
nomena.
Appendix A.15. Dr. Peter Sturrock, Stanford University
Dr. Peter A. Sturrock (1924-2024) studied at Cambridge University, Eng-
land, and was awarded the University Rayleigh Prize for mathematics. His
work on electron physics at Cambridge, the National Bureau of Standards
in D.C., and the ´Ecole Normale Sup´erieure in Paris, earned him a PhD in
1951. Much of his career was spent at Stanford University as the Professor of
Space Science and Astrophysics in the Applied Physics Department. He was
a consultant for NASA, Brookhaven National Laboratories, CERN, Boeing,
and the the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment.
In 1977, Dr. Sturrock organized a survey of members of the American
Astronomical Society [43] in which he found that out of the 1356 respondents,
23% stated that UFOs should certainly be studied and 30% said that UFOs
should probably be studied as opposed to the 17% that said UFOs should
probably not be studied and 3% that said that UFOs should certainly not
be studied. Moreover, Sturrock found that 62 of the respondents had either
witnessed or obtained an instrumental record of something that they could
not explain and that of those responding witnesses, 63% of them were night
sky observers.
Dr. Sturrock helped establish the Society for Scientific Exploration in
1982 to provide a scientific forum to subjects such as UFOs that are neglected
by the mainstream. Their publication, the Journal of Scientific Exploration,
has been published since 1987. Sturrock organized a scientific panel in 1997
to review various types of physical evidence associated with UFOs.
The
panel’s conclusions were that the cause of UFOs was complex, it needed
more physical evidence, and more attention from the scientific community
was required. Sturrock provided the details of the work by this scientific
panel in The UFO Enigma [130] as well as his view of the need for a new
paradigm in the study of UFOs in A Tale of Two Sciences [484].

Appendix A.16. Dr. Michael Swords, Western Michigan University
Dr. Michael D. Swords, Ph.D., (born 1940) obtained his doctorate in the
History of Science and Technology from Case Western Reserve University
and his Masters of Science in Biotechnology from Iowa State University.
Professor Swords is a long term board member of the J. Allen Hynek
Center for UFO Studies, and he edited the Journal of UFO Studies for six
years. With over 40 years of experience studying the UFO subject, Professor
Swords has written extensively on the two most famous examinations of the
subject: The Robertson Panel and the Condon Committee. His writings are
referenced in [121], [67], and [485].
Appendix A.17. Dr. Jacques F. Vall´ee, Documatica Research
Dr. Jacques Vall´ee (born 1939) holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics
from the Sorbonne, and a master’s in astrophysics from Lille University (see
Figure A.15).
He co-developed the first computer-based map of Mars at
the University of Texas before joining Northwestern University, where he
implemented the first interactive database of UAP cases and completed his
PhD in computer science/AI. Joining Stanford University, he did research
between the computation center and the Plasma Research Institute in studies
of pulsar and quasar energy and the solar corona.
As one of the Principal Investigators for the Advanced Research Projects
Administration of the United States Department of Defense in 1972, Jacques
led the team that developed the first network conferencing system on the
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), which was the
foundation of the internet.
After 1987, as co-founder and General Partner in the Euro-America Ven-
tures group of funds, he invested in over 60 high-technology startups (includ-
ing four future “unicorns” on NASDAQ) with partners in the US and Europe,
targeting advanced software, medicine and space technology as major themes
for the portfolio.
In 2006, Dr. Vall´ee and his two partners were selected by NASA to form
Red Planet Capital, a specialized space fund.
In 2010, Jacques Vall´ee and Chris Aubeck published Wonders In the Sky
[5], a chronological list of aerial phenomena dating back several millennia,
questioning the prosaic hypothesis of explaining witness sightings by tests of
advanced technology.
His current interest focuses on medical and industrial investments in AI
and space imagery. We present here a selection of some of his more significant
