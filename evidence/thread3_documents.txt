1, INTRODUCTION

Since 1980 on the initiative of the Ministery of Defence in
the participance of the
Scientific Rearch Heading Department of the I'linistry of
Defence, Ministeries of the Defence branches of industry and the
Academy of Science,purposeful researches aimed at the collection,
analysis, identification of the abnomal atmosphere and sPace
phenomena data (AAP) have been conducted.
The results of lhese teseatches which have been obtained by
now, show that the number of the observed in the last 10-15
years abnomal aerospace phenornena has increased greatly, which
ian be explained by the increase of the numbel of the tests of rockets
and other bpace technique, a wider use of the methods of the active
influence on the atmosphere and near Earth space in order to solve
some applied problems (injection of pencils of electrons, the
influences of electro-magnetic fields and etc. ) and the
inctease of the number of cases of anthropous influences
some military units and offices with

connected with industrial activity.

Parallel with this the numbet of not identified AAP has

increased, thesg AAP are bound with
the cases of the influences on technical equipment
of the mililary objects and technique (radioelecttonic, oplical-

electronic, electro-technical rneans, elements of energy-poweT
installations), on sensitiveness of people, which can lead to the
not adequate estimation of the situation by the operators of
radiolocating stations, by the controllers of airplane movements,
by crews of aircrafts and naval depots and other military

specialists,
AII the above mentioned information causes the necessaty to

conduct a
wide circle of researches coordinated within the framework of one
complex scientific-research progTamme and directed at the
investigation of the nature of AAP, findinq the ways and means of
defence from undesirable influence of radiaLion connected with
AAP and the possibility to use the separate features for military
pulposes.
- -At

the meeting which was conducted by The General Organizer

( military unity 10003) on the 2+ th of May 1990 with the
participation of m/u 67947, 73790 and others (Minutes N 35/0969 m
/u 67947 15.06. 1990) it was recognized expedient to concentrate
alI the investigations in this sphere on the solution of the
following questrons:
1. Th; observation, registration, identification, generalization
and classification of AAP and their influence on technical
personnel
equipment
- 2. tne and
research of physical principles of the or'igin and
development of AAP ( including physical principles of their _travel

requates subsequent improvement with due regard to the latest
achievements in the sphere of automatized collecting of all
available information on AAP not only in the Ministry of Defence
but in other organizations dealing with the same problems.
Two approaches to the investigation of problems of
pp 2 and 3 have been worked out. The first one is connected with the
observations of sporadical AAP and aimed at the research of the
origin and prognoses of the development of AAP taking into
consideration the condition of heIio-geographical activity. The

approach also includes the invesLigation of abnomal atmosphere
optical effects caused by the launchings and flights of RC I
objects and use of weapons in outer space. The improvement of the
methods of such investigations can be attained by carrying out
instrumental spectrophotometrical tesearches of the abnomal
perturbations of the upper atmosphere, which appear as a result of
rocket and space probe tests. The continuation of reseatches in
these directions can permit to teduce the number of
" inexpl i'cable'r not- identi f ied AAP.
The second approach deals with the development of new
directions of tesearches, based on the theoretical-expeTimental
analysis of various versions of AAP under laboratory conditions
with the help of the methods of mathematical and physical
model ing.
Such researches can result in the discovery of new physical laws
and fundamentally new ways of the trasfetence of maLerial objects.
Until now the works in the enumerated new directions of the
investigations of AAP haven't started yet from the initiative
stage. They need coordinative help from the Hinistry of Defence
for future development.

UFO problems, abnomal

aeTospace phenomena and non-traditional propelling agents.

The UFO problems in the USSR have been working out from the
end of the t0th -the beginning of the 50th by enthusiasts. These
investigations were conducted mainly iIlegalIy' on one's ovtn
responsibility, as the attitude of the official circles towards
the problem was distinctly negative. So, in December of 1953 the
, Moscow Radio touched upon the subject in it's broadcast, it was
declared that american imperialists had invented a stupid tale
for stirring up a war, for intimidating of taxpayers and the
Congress
in order to confirm an excessively high budget"(3T,p'e5l.
-Firstly
the investigations were limited to the collection of
facLs and iommanding the- attention of Lhe scientific-research
institutes and goveinment circles to the problem. Some UF0logists
(Fomin Y.A. for example)more than once delivered }ectures before
various special audiences. The results of these works weTe never
published- in the public press, we know about them by rerniniscences

t

6f tf," UF0Iogisti and by critical articles in the Pre:? (for
example in "Piavda" and 'rKomsomolskaya Ptavda" of the 8th of
Janulry 1951). Besides that some articles devoted to the problem

pub I i shed.
It must be noted, the idea of palaevisits appeared
considerably earlier than the first information about UFO,
particularly in the works of theosophists (311,37) and also in
science-fiction books (A, I. Efremov, A. P. Kazantzev). In the Soviet
Union science-fiction literature dealing with the problem of
palaevisits appeared at the beginning of the 50th (noticeably
earlier than in the Hest) (lll), The research of the problem of
palaevisits has being continued until now in this country, among the
wotks are the works of I. S. Lisevich, Y,_Atirtrly, V.

In the middle of the 50th an attempt was made to found the
Section of UFO problems at the Moscow House of aviation and space
exploration (chairman - general-major of aviation Stolyarov P, A. ^L
vice-chairman - science-fiction writer A. P. Kazantzev)But as the
internal political situation had changed for the worse and the
criticism against UFO problems became sharp, the attempt was a
fa i lure.
By this time in the USSR several groups of enthusiasts
dealing with the UFO problems had appeared, The most active
investigations were conducted by the group of an assistant
professor, candidate of physical-mathematical science-ZigeI F. Y.
ind a candidate of technl"ul ="ience Azhazha V, G. Mosf-6f-¤heir work
was aimed at the propaganda of the i,"p6.rEiEA of UFO problems,
the problems of palaevisits and at the collection of the information about UFO in the USSR and abroad. The important part was
paid to the popularazation of the works of american and french
UFOlogists. These works were not translated and published in the
USSR and it was difficult to find them. Up to the 70 th the propaganda of the foreign experience was their main activity,
The investigations of the abnomal phenomena problems had an
additional impulse after the first facts of UFO landings in the
USSR. They began to pay much more attention to the reseatches of
the phenomenon influence on environment and nature, The
landing places were investigated with biolocation ftames and
other instruments.Cytological and biological methods were used in
tesearches. The first works dealing with statistic analysis of
UFO appeared in the USSR.
The observalion of the ubnomal phenomenon in Petrozavodsk
("Petrozavodsk -phenomenon" e0.09. 1977) gave a new iqpfflse for
UF0JeTffiiffi- and stimulated the
physical-chemical and energetic models of the interaction of the
phenomenon with envitonment (38). Considerable scientific fotces
joined the works (for example the group of Troizki V.S, , an Associate
the USSR) . Several
l'lember of the Academy of Sc ience of
manuscripts dealing with the problem and containing great factual
material were out (16, 17, 2O). In 1983 the section approached to
the club "InveTsoT'r of the magazine I'Youth Technique" started
it's work (the leader of the section - Kuzovkin A,S. ). At the
meetings of this section many intereffifi-TE6tures devoted to the
UFO problems were delivered. In-L98{ at the All-Union Soviet of
the scienLific-technical SocietiF(now Soviet of scientific and
engineering societies) the Committee of tesealches of abnomal
phenomena under the leadership of an Associate Member of the Academy
of Science V.S. Troizki ,was organized, Until now this Committe has
organized and held noL less than 10 conferences and plenary meetings
connected with AAP problems.

(

After the abolition of the censorship according to the UFO
problems, the number of articles connected with the problem
increased greatly in the USSR. But in contrast Lo serious
investigations of the problem, the sensational articles
containing many doubtful facts, were published also. The
number of groups dealinq with the problem increased also'For
example, the Section of AAP investigations was founded at the AII

ril"' i. i i''iil#i;"X;": i'il;::' s ilil: ;;";[";ii.ll"lia##tiaEla^ol' in"
following aspects of the problem:
- the collection and analysis of the information of near
contacts with UFO and pi lots-humanoids of "flying plates"
(UFOnauts)
- the general analysis of UFO phenomenon
- the research of the peculiarities of UFO interaction with
environment, technical objects and people;
- the research of palaevisits,
Nowdays there are more than 20 groups in the USSR dealing with
the problems of AAP. The most large of them are in I'loscow, Gorky,
Kiev, Leningrad, Novosibirsk and Tomsk. In 1990 Atl Union
UF0logist Association /!b1"!_!80 centre/ was org6ii?bd with
V.G.Aihazha as it's cha'iffiiillFilGk
of the organization was
to formulate a scientific approach to the problems of UFO.
It must be noted that groups which were found
long ago, inspite of their activity in the press, are mainly
engaged in interpreting of foreign materials, introducing in them
nothing new. Parallel with this, many investigators dealing with
the working out of the problem of UFO interactions with
environment, have suggested some interesting hypotheses having no
straight analogies in foreign literature. In this connection the
idea of the complex approach to the problem of AAP and the
attempts to link it with bioenergetic features of a man (31,37)
ot researches of the possible solution of the problem of
Ievitation of rnaterial objects with the characteristics attributed
to UFO is worth attention. Nevertheless, the factual material
available in literature doesn't permit to judge with confidence if
the above-rnentioned hypotheses are worth futher deep working out.
The search of answers to these and other questions was involved in
the number of tasks considering within the frarnework of the
pToQTamme '' lnleacl-s" ln L>AI.
In contrast to the Soviet UFOloqists*enthusiasts, setting
about the research of the AAP problems at the end of the tl0th,
the representatives of the so-called official science started the
similar investigations only 30 years later.
The purposeful scientiiic researches of the abnomal aerospace
phenomena were started in the Soviet Union in 1979 with the
beginning of the work of the
famme t'Network-ANtt

to
the

'tGaIaxy-MD"
Committee of
the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR of
military-industrial problems.22.08.1980 N 255). In the coutse of
the fulfi lment of these themes the methodology of the
identification of abnomal phenomena with the conducting of rocket
technique tests and other scientific technical experiments,
including experiments exerting active influence on the upper
atmosphere of the Earth, were worked out and approbated. (38)
The obtained results showed the intetcommunication of abnomal
aerospace phenomena with the condition of the heliogeophysical
activity and interplanet magnetic field (1,3),
In order to develop the works on the problem aiming at the
further research of the nature of the possible mechanisms of the
origin and development of abnomal aerospace phenomenon and
peculiarities of their appearance and the ways of the possible
application of the attendant effects for practice, the programme
tlHorizon-MD'l which was started according to the decision of the
Comm-Ittee of the Presidium of the Soviet of Hinisters of the USSR
of military-industrial questions on 5.10.85 with the participance
of the military uniL 67947, was fulfilled during the period 198688.
Durinq this work, they obtained the results which confirmed
the role of technical factors in the origin and development of

information materials for interested
organizations of the Ministry of Defence. The issues contained
some recommendations about after-effects and the application of
attendant effects for military practice. (38)
By the decision of the- Stat* Committee of the Soviet of
Ministers of the USSR for military-industrial questions,tt.07.1988
N 25Ll the works on the problem were continued within the
proqramme "Pluton-7" from'1989 to 1990. As a result of it the
t
e spectral characterisLics
of the atmosphere luminiscence associated with the launchings
of the space technique objects in the training ground conditions
has been worked out.
Reviewing the investigations of AAP, conducting on the
professional level, during more than ten year period, it must be
stressed, that they permitted to get the first results in the
fol lowing three directions:
1, The organization of
the collection of trustwothy
information dealing with observed abnomal phenomena, it's
systematization and identi f ication.
2.The tesearch of lhe abnomal phenomena interconditionality
with the Sun activity, neophysical processes and conducting of
scientific-technical experiments in the atmosphere and space.
3. The working out of the methodology of identification of
abnomal phenomena to the known physical phenomena,
So one of the result.s of "Network-As' was "The methodological
instructions on the organization of the observations of abnomal
atmosphere and space phenomena and their
influence on
environment, living beings and technical means" which were worked
out and put into action in the l{ilitary Forces of the USSR in
1990. (38). It was also worked out a special form for the
registration of alI necessary features of abnomal phenomenon to
ensure it's full representation.
Due to the analysis and the research of aII the obtained
information, it has been founded out that the great number of
phenomena, tegarded as unknown and abnomal, are closely connected
with the conducting of active scientific-technical experiments
and tests of technique, including rocket and space-probe
launchings. (38)
In connection with this, at present the problem of abnomal
aerospace phenomena attracts the attention of the scientists
dealing with the consequences of technical influence on
environment - they are specialists in aeronomy, global ecology,
and geophysics. It is ascertained that with the beginning of the
space eata and the first rocket launching the upper atmosphere of
the Earth is engaged in the process of vety intensive
Lransformations. The technical influences on it becarne more
various and globaLIt's not only the number of rocket
Iaunchings (from geophysical probes to the large systems of shuttle
type) that has increased but also the number of reseatch powerful
influences on the upper atmosphere.

As a result of various types of technical aclivity the
space near the Earth-atmosphere, ionospere, magnetical fields are
polluted by alien components of technical origin. This activity
has already planetary consequences as the decrease of the content
of ozone (38), global rise in temperature (38), seven days

pulsating of the geomagnetical field (38). The dispersion of
various substances in the upper atmosphere influences the
luminiscense of the upper atmosphere. At present some estimations
of the results of the injections of vatious substances in the
upper atmosphere at rocket leunching have been made.

At present the task of the researches of the problem under
study is further investigations of the nature, mechanism of the
origin and development of the observed aerospace phenomena and
the possibi I ities of their appl ication or appl ication of
accompanying them effects.

2.2 The basic concepts of the investigated theme,
interconnect ion between organizat ions-executots
of the programme, the list of problems under study.

In agreement with the main lines of investigations within the
Iimits of the programme "Thread-3?' apptoved
the General

Customer /m/u N' 349/917, E.Ci. fWll
main'
programme is to conduct irilesTr'gAfions and work out the methods
of registration and identification of abnomal aetospace
phenomena, to analyse the physical principles of their origin and
progress /including the principles of their transference in space
/,their effectn on military objects, military technique and
personnel, to fulfil the experiments on the possible application
of the obtained results for the creation of military and industrial technical devices.
In the formulation of the research conception it is necessaty,
in our view, to make the most for keeping the continuaty of the main
directions of reseatches had been developed during the last ten
years in the works of the organizations-executots , with the head
of m/u 67947. The ways of further development of these lines are
fully justified in the text of Supplement 2 of the reporL /38/
./also part 3. I of the present report/, It is obvious that the
researches wiII be associated with the observations of the
sporadical AAP, the investigations of the mechanisms of their
appearance and progress in connection with geo-physical activity
condition and other factors ,/the testing and operation of rockets
Apparently the
and other space specimens and etc. /
scientific-methodological foundation of the researches in the
above*mentioned lines can be significantly improved with due
regard to the achievements of geo-physics and owing to the creation
of the automated information base possessing facts about abnomal
phenornena, and also due to application of cosmic technical devices

Along with Lhis, taking into consideration foreign experience
and the results <lf home researches, it is necessary to do away
with attempts to solve the problem at oncefonly at the expense of
collection and working out of information on AAP observations.
Parallel with hraditional lines being developed by m/u 67947, it is
important to catch up with the arears of development of the new
Iines in the researches based on the theoretical and experimental
investigation of various versions of AAP under laboratory
conditions with the application of physical and mathematical modelling.
The accomplishment of such teseatches effect the
fundamental scientific laws have been established for ages'

is advisable to use the specificity of the market relations, to find
unusual forms of cooperation which even seem to be incompatible:
of the representatives of the official science and not
t.raditional science and enthusiasts dealing with these problems
as amateurs, who are ab1e, if not to substantiate, at least to propo""
the hypothesis of the origin of AAP and to prove experimentally
the rightness of their ideas.
The determination of the priority lines of investigation in
time is of great importance for the success of the programme. None
of the fruitful ideas must be lost.
For the fulfi lment of the above-mentioned projects it is
advisable to adopt the concept of research based on the following
main propositions.
According to the analysis of the achieved level of
solution of which will ensure the fulfilment of the programme are
ascertained as follows:
L The working out of the methodological directions of the
collection, classification of information and the creation of the
automated base of data about AAP and their influence on rnilitary
and biological objects,the information of which ate leceived from
military units and other sources for the operative solution of
the special problems including the problem of AAP identification.

The first step in the investigations will be made in 1991.It
will be aimed at the complex analysis of the problem by Lhe organization-executor /m./u 73790/ with the participance of organizations co-executots, as a result at the end of 1991 a pTogramme
of complex researches for the period 1992-95 must be made. It
will cover theoretical and experimental researches nf the main
directions, with concrete instructions of laboratory stands
for conducting experiments, devices and special equipment.
The next stage in the fulfi lment of the programme must be
the conduction of theoretical and experimental investigations aimed
at more precise definition of the UFO origin and it's experimental
control testing both in
organizations co-executors
and in the laboratory experimental complex of m/u 73790, the
possibilities of which are described in Supplement 12 of the
Report /62/. The conduction of these investigation will have a
rising intensity, as in the volume of the eqiupment occupied as in
numbet of conducted experiments and will cover the period 1992-95.
The mosl intensive work is planned in 1993-91.
In the mentioned period , firstly it is necessary to conduct
theoretical reeearches of principal problems of physical and
mathematical interpretation of AAP, working out the
scientific-methodical questions of data base formation and use,
methods of calculation and modelling, mathematical
real ization, substantiations of schenres and arranging of models
/dummies/ and experimental specimen$, The main importance in this
period will have the refinement of the scientific-methodical and
organizing principles clf the research of abnomal phenomena which
can't be explained with the help of modern scientific knowledge.
Then the wotks on construct ion of rnodels wi I I be held
enl isting the cooperation of design olganizations. Private
progtammes and methods of testing will be drawn up.
In 1992 it is advisable to finish the choice and working out
of the neccessary equipment for the researches of phyiical
mechanisms of the AAP origin, development and influence on
personnel As finances are rather limited

n/u 73790 for the conduction of complex experimental researches.
In 1995 it will be necessary to generalize the obtained
results in order to use them as initial data for future works.
The task of "Thread-3" in accprdance with agreernent N 500/3
about the first stage of the works to be finished in 1991 is to
work out the hypothesis of the possible physical prerequisites

For the achievement of the mentioned task, in accordance with
the scientific technical concept of fulfilment of the "Thread-3"
progTamme, the following wain lines of research have been chosen:
the reseach of the possible nature and mechanism of
appearance and development of abnomal aerospace phenomena,
working out of methodical problems of the formation of the
information base about AAP and their influence on various
technical devices;
the research of the processes of nontraditional engines

3.2 Non-traditional propelling agents of vehicles.
3, e. 1. The riqhtfullness of setting up the problem of nontraditional propell ing agents researches.
The statement of the problem of non-traditional propelling

the flying objects in the"Thread-3"programme is based on the
/ supposition of the objective character of UFO irrespective of the
I initial reasons of the origin of such objects,though it were
objects of strangers from other planets

I"
UFO is a secret flying objects, made with the use of new
technologies in one of the hiqhly developed countries/.
In any case such supposition is rightful within the framework
of the adopted concept of investigations accordinq to which side
by side with the versions of natural and anthropogenuous vetsions
of the character of the observed AAP we can wor.k out the versions
of their objective character, especially in non-iderttified cases.
According to the above-mentioned supposition, it is necessary
to conducl widerange investigations in order to find out the new
principles of non-traditional propelling agents and accompanying
fields, which functioning and influence on environment don't
differ from those described by "eye-witnessesrt processes
of functioning and influence of UFO. To the characteristic
features of UFO

according to the information of the press and periodical editions
the following /17/:
object's shape - more oflen it is a shpere, cylinder,disks;
luminiscence - bright I ight with pulsating, multi -coloured,

sound - characteristic hum, crackling, the absence of the
sound from the wave collapse at M/ 6

other unusual features - unusual influence on environment,
maLerial traces of their appeatance.
The enurnerated indications have cast some doubt on the
application of traditional propelling agents in UFO/jet engines

advice the investigators of untraditional levitation of material
systems and different physical fields.

pay attention
to the fact that from
the'tgeneral theory of relativity" it is
followed that rotating masses can be a sourie and therefoie a reception
of the radiated povrer in the form of graviradiation, Though the fact that the small quantity of Einstein's Constant prognoses the
laboratory impossibi I ity
of reception and radiation of
substensial energy quantities. Only large stella rnasses can
generate the measured flows. To the investigators, mind
Einstein's constant can be call in question. This opinion is not
indisputable. Nevertheless the sarne authors expresi the opinion
which you can't but agree: I'The truth can be deteimined only-after

3,e.3. The investiqation of the oriqin of the processes of
solid bodies levitation with the tapping of strictly-ordered
atom i c-molecular structures,

In Supplement 9 to the Report/61 / iL is set forth in a
condensed form a fundamentally new, in the author's opinion
/P.L Rusanov and V. D. Fedorovich/ concept of levitation as a

physical phenomenon, "achieved by constructing strictly-ordered
molecular structures of surface layer of a material body". To the
authors' idea /which is rather hard for undetstanding for readers
not acquainted wiLh terminology/"levitation/imponderabi I ity/ as a
phisical phenomenon may be concieved as a property of
strictly-ordered molecular structures of some chemical elements /
moleculas on tlaeir base/ and the basis of which it is ensuted the
formation of strictly-ordered /with designated direction and
densily,/ fluxes of proper radiation in plasmoids /microstars,
teleases, microleptons/,
To the theoretical ideas of authors "ordered and/directed/
fluxes of such plasmoids when interrelating with outer field
radiation /including gravitational/, stop the interaction./on the
fluxes' level/the structures of a given body with surrounding
outer material bodies, which appeares as the effect of
imponderability", Such theoretical views are not shared by the
is decleared in
repsentatives of the"official" science. It
Supplement 3, part 2 /25/: "The ideas of substance structure,
developed in the text of the review /6L/ are of no value, because
nobody besides the authors can understand the idea. Generally
accepted concepts and notions about substance structure are
practically absent, and introduced plasmoids /l /:nicrostaTs,
releases, microleptons have no distinct definitions. As a result
the value of the theoretical part is equal to zeto. "
The most interesting in the materials of Supplement 9/6I/ in
our opinion,as in the materials of all other authors,drawn in the
wotks on "Thread-3", is presented in the experimental part. It is
presented the experimantal installation scheme for measurement
"the coefficient of levitation of the non*ordered structutes of
solid bodies in the form of ferro-magnetic structute".
The essence of the experiment is as follows:
at the rotation of the platform with a femomagnetic pellicle
/packet/ as time passes, Lhe process of "the accumulation of
microleptons, teleases, microstars,/" in the centre of rotation
starts. The evolved into existance "cloud of microleptons changes
/lessens/ Lhe force of gravitational interaction between the
tested body and the Earth". It appeares as "a tested body weight
loss, which in it's turn reduces the angle of the twisting of the
spring thread rsith secured to it ref lecting mirrclt". 'rThe change
of the angle of Iaser flux incidence is reflected on the
calibrated diat in the screen. Mote over the paramount part in
the appearance of the levitation effect, as it seems to the
authois, is assigned to the ferromaghetic pellicle, manufactured
due to the technology, suggested by the authors /khow-how/, and

On the

second stage of the fulfi lment of the programme
"Thread-3" the authors suppose to repeat control experiments with
the demonstaration of the obtained effect.
In the"official" Review /25/ the attention was paid to the
main shortcomings in the experimental part: the absence of the
description of the experimental weighing of tested bodies. In the
review it is also noted, that any combination of superconducting
of
/the authors have an indication to the
pellicles/ and magnetic pellicles can lead to"superconductors"
the results similar
to those described in the work /61l but it bears no relation to
the process of shielding of a gravitational field.
It is also noted, that the combination of magnetic and electric
fields of different materials, circulatinq and not rotating can lead
to the analogous results, Nevertheless, in physicists' opinion,
expressed in the review, special experiments dealing with
weighing of tested bodies must not be conducted on the authors'
installations, as these expeTiments aTe veTy delicate and it is
possible to conduct them only in well-equipped laboratories /in
the USSR an Associated-Member of the Academy of Science
V. B. Braginsky is a master of such experiments,/.
At the sam6 time, inspite of the precautions of professional
physicists, in our opinion, it is advisable to give a chance to
the authors of Supplement 9 to demonstrate the possibility of
solid bodies levitation, with "strictly-ordered atomic-molecular
structure" during fulfilment of the second part of the programme
r?Thread-3" in 1991. In the case of even little success of this
experiment, it
could be repeated wilh the application of
"delicate" methods of weiqhing, and also with the use of a
centrifude, working out for the programme "Thread-3" in SDEB of
the Ministry of Atomic Energetic Industry of the USSR ./Supplement
3, part 3 /2;5/. It mustn't be excluded the possibility of
conducting control experiments in V. B. Braginsky's laboratory.

3.2. Ll. Researches of the statement and exanrination of the
hypotheses about the physical mechanisms, as the
basis of the processes of functioning of non-traditio-

nal propelling-agents as Sarl's machine
The largest attention at the first stage of the fulfilment of
the programme "Thread-3tt was paid to the researches of
non-traditional proppeling agents as SarI's machine, because the
forming of the new direction in the Teseaches of abnomal
aerospace phenonrena is closely connected with
it. Many
theoreticians, expeTimentalists and designers were enlisted to
work out the given line.
The results of the first stage of researches come to
the fol lowing.
Scientistsophysicists from the United Institute of Nuclear
Researches AS USSR, the Moscow University, IAE after
I.V.Kurchatov have made a qualitative examination of the physical
principles of non-traditional levitation of material systems in
vatious physical fields. The results of this exarnination are
presented in Suplements 2/21 ,22/,3/"5/ and 6/32/.
Main attention was paid to the treatment of levitation in
known physical fields within the framework of physical laws of
consetvation. Simulteneously, changing the usual oppinion about
'?off icial'rscientists as I'orthodoxrt who hamper the development
of new ideas, the same scientists treat the idea of the possible
way out of our thinking to the quatatively new level which helps
to accept and comprehend logically new physical fields and
variants of movement effecting the dynamics of abnomal phenomena
plocesses.
Sarl's machine has been taken into consideration as a
material system possesing the features of non-traditional
levitafion to the greatest degree. It's description has been
already given in part 2.L? /the foreign publications about
Sarl's machine are presented rnore completely in Supplement 2,
part { /?lJ'/.
Proceeding from the assumption, that Sarl's machine exists
reaIIy, physical'principles which can explain the operation of
this machine, it's levitation in air space and vacuum have been
exarnined. 0n the first stage the Iimiting statistical estimation
of the physical fields /within the framework of the conservation
laws/ which can bring to the levitation of the machine with a
great possibility.Uith alI this, Ieaning on the principles given
in Part 2,3, which are under explanation from the view of modetn
science, it has been accepted necessary to use the principle of
"Okkamats razorrtin full measure - to examine SarI's machine as a
Ievitating object within the framework of known physical fields
and physical IEws of conservation and only after that sequentially and methodically try to solve the problem under fundamen-

tally new hypotheses.

Among the possible ways of producing levitation they have
considered not only known ways as / l'leisner's effect
n"i*ti"g Archimed's'force in airrpur" and others/ but ut=o olh"r
methods of non-traditional science with it's new physical ideas /
the interaction of electro-magnetic and stationary fields of
acceleration with the curveness of space-time, gravitational
waves, generating marked "channels" in space, "demon" of l'laxwell,
biofields, exotic particles: axions, microleptons and others/.
lJhile considerinq non-traditional new ways, attention was paid at
one of the interesting possibilities of creation of a f ield in

t4

redi str i bur ion Ji"irllil:fiJ:":;';;:ffi r ilia5' iT[t'if,"'"f;"t;":i
outer ray fields, which would ensure the transference of the
object in a preset direction. Unfortunately, the search of this
new effect is made difficult by the lack of strict theory of
physical vacuum as inferior energetic state of quantum fields.
Together with this
"official" physics, as well as
representatives of non-traditional science, developing the line
of "totaty gravitation"/part 3.2,2/ express an opinion that
"though today the real possibility to create the laboratory
project of a levitating object on the basis of vacuum effects
doesn't exist, it's only the question of time, as the science of
physical vacuum is picking up quickly.
0n the first stage due to the principle of "Okkama razor" the
levitation of Sarl's machine is considered in ditail subject to
the physical laws of conservation.
From the descrition of Sarl's machine /29./ it appeares that
it consists of combined magnitized and current carrying elements.
The dynamics of such systems is well-known, it fully conforms to
the physical laws of consetvation and can be detaily analysed
within the framework of
electro-dynamics, aerodynamics,
gravitaltional dynamics. In principle this problem has no special
physical paradoxes and it's full solution is only a question of
time, The coop¤rative organizations participants of the programme
"Thread*3" have already started the preparation of the full
mathematical model of the functioning of SarI's rnachine. The
first results of this work are presented in Suppl inent-s/Z?/
According to the constant of interaction, it can be expected
that the most force influence on Sarl's machine must be exerted
by the field of force of electro dynamic type, generated in
airspace just around the machine. The sources of these variable
in time and space electro-magnetic fields are rotating permanent
magnet made in a roller form. Variable electromagnetic fields
induce in the machine elements and airspace electric current of
conduction, Obviously, magnetic fields and currents of conduction
can produce an outer force and effect the rnachine as a hoisting
force.
All cclmbined forced including in a hoisting force are
presented in Fiq.3.
The conduction of maximum estimations of these fotces show
that forces bound up with the Earth magnetism count very little
in the generation of Lhe force of levitation. These forces can
only be used for the correction of the movement of a levitating
systern. Electro-dynamic forces can have a sufficient value for
producing a hoisting levitation force.
The variant of producing of hoisting force with the help of a
combined electro-dynamic system has been also analysed. The
question is about aerodynamic force which can be produced in
nrachines with two magnetic t'skirtst'- uppeT and lower - by placing
aerodynamic wings in these skirts /Fig.\/
0n the base of the analysis of forces taking part in
producing of a hoisting force of SarI's machine, the construction
of the electro-magnetic model, the general view of which is
presented in Fig.5 has been worked out.
The description of the test model and working place .where
experimental r6searches are planned to be held is given in
experimental
SupplemenL 4 /28/ The manufacture of the first
models is planned in 111-lY q. of 1991
The model consists of a disk with radial ribs, equipped with
a circle shell-skirt. Disk is made of electro insulating material.
Four coils with cores-magnetic-conductots are installed on the
brackets of the disk, evenly along the circle. Intermediate
canals are sifuated between the coils in the disk's windows. On
the opposite sides of the canal along the force lines of electromagnets electrodes aTe fixed, one of which is smooth and the

llhi le investigating the processes of sarl's machine
functioning, two approaches to- the problem appeared. The first
approach has been considered above. It has been developed by
A. F, Pisarev, a
doctor of physical and mathlmaticil
science, professor.
The second approach is being worked out under the leadership
of R. N, Kuzmin, a professor, doctor of physical mathematicalscience, This approach is based on the statement, that the
construction of Sarl's machine according to it's description in
literature can clear up it's main constructive features and
phy:ical principles, which permits to f ind right ways of it's
real ization.
For the lack of time which was planned for the futfilment of
the first part of the programme, they have only managed to
manufacture only the model of the central ?rgyrocell't of SarI's
machine /CDEB of the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the USSR/ which
is drawn in Fiq.5. A detai led description- of the model and
glperiments fulfilled with it's help are presented in Supplement 3.
It has been established experimentally, that it is possible t<l lessen
the I inks of cyl indrical magnets/rollers./ to the posts of the
both rings of the "gyro-cell" , so at a definite rite it can
appear a suspending system of cylindrical magnets, which turns
around the system axis and around their own axis in vacuum
without friction, which can practically exclude dissipations
in the elements of the construction of SarI's disk. In Kuzmin's
opinion the optimization of magnetic f ields conf igurations can be
achieved only gxperementally. Even the first expeiiments with the
glven simple model have shown, that some peculiarities can appear,
to take them into consideration when constru-ting
tt iq necessary
testing
stands. The description of one of the stands is given in
Supplemenl 3/25/.
In such a vray as to research NFA by the example of Sarl,s
machine, it is necessary to work out and construct two types of
experimental modelsr
-an electro-dynamic model for the investigation of the
possibilities to obtain a hoisting force in the iir by the effect
of electric and magnetic fields generated by outer electric
energy on the particles of air,
-a magnetic model to conduct experinrents with magnets in order
_ research
to
the appearance of variable magnetic fields with the
interaction of permanent magnets, fixed in rollers and rings,
analogues of SarI'machine elements.
It is supposed to use a laser magnetometer of the Institute
of Sinenergetics of the MU fol measurements.
For conducting the first control experirnents the possibility
to use working places in SIU "Red Star" and in CDEB of the
Ministery of atomic energy will be considered. In future in 199293 these experiments will be continued at the experimental
complex of m./u 73790, the depiction of which is presented in
Supplement 12 /62/. The scheme of the stant for such expeliments
is pictured in Fig.7. in Suppliments.

3.3. Functional physical fields and formed radiation.

In the I'eye-witnesses'rr reports about UFO observed by- them,
it is often noted, that they felt the effect of sone
supernatural forces and influences of invisible resilient
obstacles which don't permit to approach at UFO and so on. Many
uFOlogists consider that one of the character features of uFO i;
the presence of both usual well-known radiations lfot example,
electro-magnetic/ and unusual abnomal radiation able to exert
unfavourable influence on people and technical devices.
So being consistent and continuing the version of the
objective character of UFO suggested in part 3.2, we suppose that
the appearance of UFO must--occur witir some unknown und little
known fields interplaying with environment. According to this i
we can't exclude the fact that these fields are not only
"by-products?' of UFO functioning, but determine ingeneously UFO
functioning or the vrork of impellent and energetic plants.
Considering only their role in functioning it has been agreed to
calI such little known fields "functional physical fields"/FPF/ at one
of the meetings of future co-executors of the programme
"Thread-3" which was held in September 1990.
The research of FPF under conditions when we haven't got even
trustworthy scientific information of the sources of UFO, the
problem seems to be practically unsolvable. The only possible way
to investigate FPF in Iink with UFO in our opinion is the way
of the inderect research of the phenomenon presented in part 3.2.
The successful interpretation of this way was presented
by
specialists of'the Physico-energetical Institute of -the Ministry
of atomic energy industries /part 3, SupplemenL 5 /3I//:,, It is
necessary to conduct detai led, wide-scale researches of the
effect of some little known fields on physical, chemical and
other features of substance in oder to expose the fields which
influences will not differ from those of UFO. No Iess important
task of such researches is to find out physical principles of
their functioning in the energetic and other main sy-tems of
these objects.
This problem is rather widespread and at present only main
_
lines of it can be presented. As the main lines on the -first
stage of the fulfi lment of the progTamme "Tread-3't were chosen
the following;
1/ the extention of all known and little known data about
FPF, versions of their origin, progressing and interaction with
env i ronmentl
Z/Lhe revealing of the ways r:f identif ication FPF and their
registration.
For conducting this
investigations in the outlined
directions, representatives of Iarge scientific schoola and of
the so-called non-traditional science, including specialists with
extrasensor ab i I ities have been recruited. The prel iminary
results of these researches and their analysis are presented in
Supplements 3/25-e7,5/2'9-3I /, 9 /35/, LO/36 and 1 L /37 /.

presenting results in the report it was used in full measure "the

2.3. So the materials of authors representatives of "untraditjonal
science" ryere jncluded in Supplements 5 /part 2/,9,10, ll without
editing, The scientists' reviews of some parts of the given
material are presented in Supplement 3 /25-27/ and 5 /29-31/.
However a search for untraditional interpretations of FPF has
touched upon a large amount of information, and it has turned out
that reviewers were unable to work out this Ilarge arnount of
information during a short period of time. /fron 25.05.91-the
beginning of the financing of the programme "Thlead-3" by the
General Customer/. The analysis of these materials wi II be
continued during the second stage of the plogramme.
The most exotic versions of the origin of FPF and their
interaction with environment are plesented in Supplement 11 /37/.
They are connected with suppositions about close interplay of
"antigtavitational"technologies, "death barrier" and forms of
cosmic consciousness, possible influence of consciousness on a time
flow. Such interpretations have appeared lately in different
variants in UFOIogists' groups, groups dealing with bioenergetic
effects and others. The importance of this direction in
investigations of FPF and linked to it in it,s processing formed
radiation, wilI be estimated by the "official science".
However, inspite of uncomronness and imperfection of style in
these materials, it was decided to include them in the materials
of an intermediate report, though for their systematization and
future discussion.
"llicrornagnetic theory" widely popularized in the press and on
TV by A.F.Ochatrin is not less exotic. The final opinion of this
theory has not been yet formulated by the "official science". But
even on the first stage of investigations it was called in
question in Part 2,Supplement 3 /?;5b/ and in Part 1 Supplement 5
/29/. The main shortcoming is the lack of proofs of the author,s
theoretical materials, the absence of the replicates of
experiments, which are to prove the possibi I ity of the
registration of "microlepton"FPF / Durinq 9 month period of close
work with the head executors of the programme A.F.Ochatrin failed
to demonstrate control experiments in confirmation of his already
publ ished results/.
In oder to check up the way nf the registration of
"nrictoIepton"FPF and FS suggested by A.F.0chatrin, experimentall
installations for control experiments were manufactured /with the
use of "black box" in SIU "Granat" /?9,30/ and in the organization
-general executor /29/ /.
These control experiments must play the determining part in
the estimation of the truthfulness of the "microlepton"theory of
FPF and FR, because this theory seems to exist only owing to
the fact that serious scientists don't want to investigate it.
The control testing of the "microlepton"interpretation of the
processes ensuring the work of the so-called Tesl's generator ,/30
/ was conducted in SIU "GranaL"/29/, 0n the special case of this
generator it has been shown that it's work can be explained with
the help of modern science without invoking exotic hypotheses.
The theoretical description oF the generator and the results
of experirnents explain that the essence of the phenomenon can
come to the conditional resonance of various processes going on
in one system, namely: it was established the resonance of
cyclotronic frequence for electrons /the second subgarmony/ and
frequency of the running wave of the current in the wire turned
in spiral.
Besides that in the work /29l were considered short impulse
of micro r^rave radiation as a type of FPF. It has been noted, that it
has some unusual features, which A. F. Ochatrin has subscribed to
microlepton formed radiations and FPF:
-high penetrational ability, also in screened objects,
-biological influence at insignificant middle impulse capacity
-high effectiveness of influence on semi-conductional

ls

Such features can be applied to engineering.

In this way, preliminary investigations on the first stage
has found out that at present information about FR and FPF in
official editions is practically absent, the origin of FR and FPF
hasn't been defined, and the work of corlesponding technical
installations has not been justified. Only subjective features of
FR and FPF and some constractive peculiarities of instruments and
installations for generating and usage of FR and FPF have been

general ized.
0n the second stage of the programme the researches of FR and
FPF it is planned to discuss the versions of the representatives
of "non-traditional" science, to conduct control experiments
confirmung the existed hypotheses of the FFP and FR origin and
their interaction with environment.

3.t.The peculiarities of AAP, NPA, FR and FPF interaction
with biological objects and necessary precautionary measures.
Hhen observing abnomal phenomena/objects/ in some cases the
deflections and defects of the operation of radioelectronic,
opticoelectronic, electrotechnical instruments, rnechanical
devices of military objects and technique and besides that the
influence on the sensory apparatus of people have been
registered. It can lead to the following grave consequences: nonadequate estimation of the situation by the operators of radio
location stations, controllers of movement of transport, crews of
aircrafts, naval depots; difficulties in the fulfi lment of
special purposes with the use of aparatuses under influence.
The facts of UFO influences on people and biological objects
are plesented in Suppliment II to the Report.
As a head executot in the researches deal ing with
peculiarities of AAP, NPA, FR and FPF interaction with biological
systems and working out of necessary precautions, MSIE

"Druzhina" has been chosen.
As initial points in the science activity of the enterprise
have been noted the following:
- the consideration of the operator conditions under fields

influence, with the supposition that any outer influence can
come in Tesonance with his private endocrine system rhythms and
can intensify some of them, causing desynchronism in functioning
oF an organism as a whole;
-the choice of the definite sequences of measures aimed in

the first place at teaching a person to determine the fact
of danger and then to work out actions of precaution adequate to
the level of outer f ield's inf luence.
Uith aII this the ptogramme of working out precautionary
measures at conducting experiments of FR and FPF is concluded in
the following:
l.the study of the conditions of biosystems under the effect
of non-identified radiation spreading in the extend of various
types.
2. the study of the dependence of biosystem reactions on
FR and FPF influence;
3. the evolution of devices for the control of the condition
of biosystems under non- identified radiations.
1. the working out of
the vrrays of indication of
non-tradit ional radi ation influence.

2/ Luninous effects:
0n the night of 27.09.1989 Dzhapakov, Porsev and a biologist,
Peteris by name observed on the field/at the same place, where we
saw"coquettes"an orange spot 1,5 metre in diameter, it "'swam"
above the field at 10-15 cm.height above the field. Dzhapakov and
Porsev stayed on the road, and Peteris went to the spot and
stepped in it. He felt as if he was in an ice-hole. Dzhapakov and
Porsev saw that the spot disappeared, then appeared again behind
Peteris; Peteris went forward and the spot followed him and then
faded away. Peteric went back to us and told us about the feeling
of cold.
Dzhapakov saw illuminating columns at the height lower then
the crowns of trees. He also saw a star shining through the
branches of trees. Then the star began to come nearel to him. It
was blue-violet, Iike a coin in visual size. It moved here and
there ftom side to side as if playing, so he called it a
"coquette" and when he saw the same in the fi ld two nights later
he said: "0h, ah old acquaintance"
0n 29,09.89, in the daytime, on their way from l{olebka /they
went there to buy bread,/ Dzhapakov and Porsev sabr two flashes:
one above trees was strong and the other against the background
of the trees and it was weaker. On the same day our photographer
made a photo of an illuminating small ball in branches. The ball
was in the piclure and beside it there were two more balls a bit
smaller at the foot of another branch which was l0 metres nearer
to him.
0n the night 29.09.89. several people from a large group saw
a iIluminating balI, "dumb-bells" and stripes. Two men from the
group went to lhem, but suddenly two sticks connected by a thread
appeared in front of them at 5 metres distance, They effected
danger. So the men were frightened so that they started to
move backward fot some time and then turned back and ran away.
0n the night of 3. 11.89 two young men frorn Tumen,
psychiatrists by profession came to examine to their words the
cases of mass psychosis, At about four o'clock a, m. they were
awakened by a terrible noise. They went out of the tent quickly,
they saw an illuminating opasity sphere at 10 metre height above
the river /their tent was on the bank of the river/ it flew by
them at 30 metres distance. It was about 20 metres in diameter.
After that it lifted above the steep bank and seemed to land near

0n 28,09.89 we met a group from the city of Kalinin near the
Zone. One girl from this group heard the call and went out of the
tent and stood stock still
as if praying. There was also a
professional photographer who spoiled atl his films by light not
by chance, he was very much upset but couldn't explain who rnade
him do that.
Dzhapakov told that on 27.09,89 two physics ftom Karelia came
to his tent and asked him to see them to the village. They were
very much afraid, their Iips were white,eyes were empty. To all
questions they only answered: "No. . . No. . .

A group from Riga conducted an experiment they put a
mechanical watch in a can and digged this can. The watched lost
15 min. for a day, but then worked right.
Porsev made a photo of people around the fire. In the picture
there was a forrnation like a tree with branches on which there
were illuminating brushes. The tree was semi-transparent. The
same effect was in Kunin's picture. They both said that it wasn't
the defect of emulsion.
A group from Votkinsc went to the Zone once more in November.
They saw two stars sink on the river. In the morning they went to
this place and {g,gnd two ice-hol cut. The circles of ice 180 cm

5/The stories of inhabitants of this place:
The flight of various objects, of different colours and shape
f lew regularly,/1-2 times a month, more often in winter. They were
observed by many people of different professions, a director of a
school, an inspector of the State insurance company, a sai lor and
others. They told that balls flew and landed in the Zone.
Children ran there and tried to find landing places, but failed.
There are no mashrooms and berries in the Zone, though on the
opposite bank there are a lot of them. 0nce they found a high
metal stick digqed in the ground, they tried to take it off and
didn't manage. But when they returned Lo the place on the next
day they found nothing but a hole. The director of a sovchoz told
that people often saw disks and balls, he saw them even in his
chi ldhood.

Not far from the village Andropovo milkmaids and a watchruan
saw black giants without heads not far from the farm.
Schoolboys from l'lolebka also saw them too. The giants u,ere
two men high, don't permit to come to them, immidiately hid and
went into the forest.
A rnan who put us across the river told that he never saw thern

asked: "Do you i.rant to know everything?" He was taken aback. Then
he realized that he was not laughed at, that he was talking with
the representatives of an alien wor1C. Firstly it was mere guesswork, but then he was sure, when he realized that he was hearing
the russian language not with his ears, but with the back of his
head. They explained to him that in order to get great knowledge,
it was necessary to comprehend the inner sense of the alphabet
and accordingly the sense of basic words of the language, that

way to

sponteneously. tBelesin's ruemory,
his own wordl was very- bad.
But their lecture on the alphabet he temembered for all his life
word for word, as if it had been recorded on the tape inside his
head.

The main part of their

lecture was devoted to the alphabet

was presented in his book "Cosmos and werr. The rest part of his
book presented his own conjectures based on the secrets of the
alphabet.Fron the point of view of specialists, there are many
questionable and even incompetent places in his book. But among
this dirt there ate some nuggets of gold, which are very
surprising as the author hasn't even secondary education and
knows very little the basic scientific subjects.

lJhiIe being in contact Belesin asked them a very important

queslion: "In what earth

sauTces were the

cosmic wisdom
an
ancient
answer: "... in
religious-philosophical teachings and in ancient epos.
The additional information is as follows. They said that
earthmen wete worthless in most cases, but there were wonderful
exceptions among them, for whom the work on saving our
civilization was conducted, for in future these exceptions would
be in majority. There was a so-called "The Soviet of the Elders"
in the cosmos ,/extrasages/, which had the functions of
coordination and solved the most important intergalaxy problems.
The duration of Iife of the representatives of these high
civilizations was much longer than our, and the duration of Iife
of the membets of this "Soviet" was practically unlimited, There
were no war conflicts between high-developed civilizations.
At parting they promised Belesin their help and support, if he
clashed with difficulties in his "missionary" activity.
Some interesting places from his book-report are seL forth
below,
proper names, UFOs are
"CaIIing things by their
representatives of more developed civilizations in the universe.
Nevertheless even people being in contact personally can
not answer the questions, who they are and where they conre
from, what the purpose of their visits is.
. . . UF0nauts sometimes contact personally with our people, and
choose from us those, who can't present in a clear, convincing
form the meaning of this contact, because of their low intellect
and illiteracy. And that's fine, because as a result we have "a
smoke without a fire" or "believe it or not". And it is good,
because our world is not yet free from mystisism and
superstition't/cornpare it with Kostrikin's words-L. Ch/
But however hete logic fails him. Because this secrecy of
these contacts only increase these superstitions. But what can we
do? They know best. So it is necessary to be so.
Belesin and ,YaIisheg mention unusual smiles of visitors from
alien planets. Belesin: "It is as if a flower blossoms out...t'

a young hroman /IeL's cal I her 4,. /,
biophysicist, took place on the night of October 3 in the town of
Pushino. She didn't sleep that night, as she suffered from
insomnia, she came out to a balcony. Suddenly, above the Oka from
the side of the forest Teserve a saturn-shaped, metallic
apparatus appeared. Firstly some light columns seemed to separate
from the apparatus. They were about twenty of them. These colurnns
started to dislocate above Pushino. Then she discerned that these
columns were "standing people" in the uniform of soldiers-border
guards, their faces were young and as if paralysed.
One of them was flying near my balcony to the nest. I was
afraid that he would frighten people and there would be a scandal
there, so I made a jesture inviting him, and he immediately
turned back and stood near me on nNy balcony noiselessly.He looked
about 19, and was about 1.90 metres tall...
I was silent and he
said in Russian smiling:
-Have you real ized who I am?
-Yes, but why are you in this uniform?
-I would I ike to speak with you. . . ./And further the
conversation continued in the room,/.
-You are speaking Russian very well
-I have tuned up, and speak the same language my interlocutor
does.
-But you were going not to me.
-No, to you.But usually people are frightened very rnuch and

with anthropoid ape. . . And suddenly we f.und
ourselves in a plimitivi comruunity society and so on. He
explained that it was only the world I imagined had nothing in

common with real history.

IJe learnt all our history

for

about

twenty minutes...
I told him, that we,/the Soviet Union,/ considered our society
to be the best. He smiled. I said, lhat we had no private
property and etc. I explained to him what this private property
meant, I told him about colonial wars. In connection with wars I
told him about Ulster, and suddenly we were there, and everything
was very real there. . . He said that it was real ity. I was
frightened and he made us return ,/further A. saw aII these Ulster
exchanges of fire on TV-L. Ch. / Then we were somewhere in Asia, in
jungle and saw mutual annihilation of two bands of druggs'

sellers...
I asked him, why they didn't want to contact with us. He said
that they had studied our planet very well. "You earth-men can't
understand our interests. According to our notions your planet
would be able to
include in our system of interplanet
communications, but your morals are very low. Your mankind has
been following a wrong way and has come to a deadlock. Your
thinking is very mean and hard. It's all mankind's feature."
I as our earth patriot tried to prove that we were not so bad
as he said, that we knew about our imperfection. He said, that we
couldn't realize this, and there brele very much dark in us.
He said that we were to find the way out ourselves. They
t
didn't know another place in the Universe to be so complicated.
But he said that our earth science permitted us to learn much in
I
the system of intetcosmos communication, but rrre couldn't. be
L allowed to it,
I asked whether the theory of the pulsating universe was
riqht /remember Kostrikin's words/
He said that it was a wrong idea connected with our false
way of thinking.
It seems to me that they are only observing us and not going
to help /because we simply have other"guardians"information got
from Malishev and Kostrikin/.
I asked: "lJhere are you from?" He asked: "Do you know
asttonomy?" I answered: "As much as a biologist can". He smiled
and said: "It iE a h'ay of cognition and education can't be
due to sciences, either you have education or not...[Je are very
far from here, so far that I can't even explain to you - from the
Universe". He said that our Earth was a very convinient place for
communication. It seemed to me that we were not very irnportant
phenomenon on the Earth for them. I was upset and he felt it. . . He
was surprised at our division into countries...Ue have a great
difference between people. They have nothing of the kind. They
have a great difference only between children and grown-ups.
The talk was as follows:
He strove for learning much about us and about themselves
talked only when I asked, answeted very briefly and often evaded
a question. He said: "You wi ll not understand". He couldn't
understand, what out earth love meant. llhat a fami ly was, he
understood. They have no families. Love and children exist.They
have no states. He said that dividing in states was wiId.
He asked me to treat him as if he was my husband for him to
realize the essence of our earth love. I answeted that I couldn.t
as it contradicted my rnorals /A. is married-L.Ch. / He didn't
consider the formation of a new being to be connected with
love. "It is a deed". And their love is something very different,
an exchange of inormation, ecstasies, a part of a spiritual
mystery, which they protect in each other...

-Ue feel where many intellectual people are.

-lJe can assume any pleasant for each other aspects.

come to the next one.

-Does hatred exist?
-No, you can't understand this.
-lJhat is our future?
-Your planet will not be ruined.
But I felt that his attitude towards people was so that it
was unimportant for him.
-your have a horrible way of thinking and thrust your opinion
on you children. IJhen the way of your thinking changes, then you

wiII change morals.
He said that it was already dawning and it

was time to

go

back. . .
IJe came again to the balcony. He didn't give his hand, he
didn't touch me at all. He I'swam" in the air in the same way,
then turned inio a r?stick'r and approached to the ball and the
ball dissolved in the air..,ft was about tl a.m. and allthis began

at 2 p.m."
Here ate presented the most interesting questions and answers
during my interview with A.:
1. lJhere did they fly?
-He said-they fly to themselves. He said that their task was
to establish connections among all civilizations of the UniveTse.
They flied along this way of connection. He said that it made
sense to
establish this connection frorn time to time. I
asked: "lJhat for?" He said: "You can't real ize this problem".
Z. llas it said anything about children's origin?
-He told me:"You can't understand that, but it is a result of
sexes interaction. Children ate great blessing.
3. Tell me please about the mystery of eveTy person as much
as it is possible /in comparison with us/
- LIe propect the mystery of another person very much and
don't interfere. lle have no bad thoughts and hostility.
If we
know that it has appeared something secret in somebody, we wait
till these thoughts will mature and he will tell us about them.

J

(

Other persons mysteries are common weal".
"Death is simply a trasFerence in another forms and it comes
according to our wills"...He told me, that I had a great fear
of death. That here on the Earth this fear surprised him.
Everyone has it, it is some motive force...
In conclusion it must be mentioned that before this contact
A. considered all stories about UFO to be pure inventions.

Certainly, the cases have been nrentioned above are only a
small part of all cases that have had place in this country.

that persons who had the right to work with secret documents,

then was occupied by General llalter B. Smit.
On June Z1 19ry7 a pilot of the civilian aviation, making a
flight in the region of the Rocky llountains, saw nine'disc-sh-ped
apparatus
in a I ine at a very high speed. Though it was
-flyingfact
not the first
of observation of obje-ts of the kind, this
event gave an impulse for a wide public information. It was
followed by hundreds of reports about observations of such

objects, a lot of them were received from rather truthful
milit.ary and civilian saurces.
These reporLs were analysed independantly by various
divisions of l'lilitary Forces in oder to f ind out it's origin in
the interests of the state security.
Many eye-witnesses were examined and several unsuccessful
attempt to pursue discs with aviation were delivered. The
reaction of the population uras on the verge of hysterics.
Inspite of the plenty of attempts, the investigation of the
phenomenon hadn, t advanced since the information from a native
farmer came, that one of the objects had been crashed in one of
the far situated regions of New-Hexico state, at about 75 miles
to the north-wgst of the military base RosewelI /now Yorker FeId/.
0n July 7 19t,7 a secret operation in order to find and
scientifically'investigate the fragments of the object was
started. During the operation our air reconnaissance found also
four anthropoid creatures, which had thrown themselves out from
the apparatus before it blew up. They fell down on the ground at
approximate distance of 2 miles to the east of the place where
the apparatus was found, The all four were dead, mutilated and
had decomposed greatly as for a week they had been preys of
rodents, beatles and microorganisms.

A special scientific
group took these bodies for
examinations. /Iook at supplement ttctt/
The fragments of the apparatus were also taken for a complex
investigation. ,/look at supplement "B"./
AII military and civilian witnesses signed an obligation not
to tell anybody about the event, and the version was spread that
the object was a hydro meteorological research ballon having lost

control off.
Jh" preliminary secret analysis organized by General Twining
and Doctor Bush due to the direct instruction of the President
showed /September 19 I9q7/ that disc resernbled a smalI
reconnaissance apparatus most of alI. This conclusion was based
on the fact that the apparatus had the size of a reconnaissance
air-craft and had no reserves on board. /Iook at supplement "D"/.
A detai led analysis of the four dead members of the crew was
made by Doctor Bronk. From the preliminary conclusion of this
group it followed though they looked like men, biological and
evolving processes of their vital providing differed greatly from
those of horno-sapiens.
The group of Doctor Bush introduced a temporary term 'rout-ofearth biological creature -OBC for calling these creatures
somehow, with further possible change of this name on the nest
stages of researches.
It was presented as unquestionable that the apparatus hadn't
been made on the Earth. The main problem under study was the

origin of these creatures and the ways of their coming to our
Mars was suggested as a possible base , though some
scientists, especially Doctor Hensel considered them to be from
another solar system more possible.
Some fragments of their apparatus had marks resembling
hieroglyphes. All attempts to decipher these marks were failures.
/look at supplement "E"/ and also the attempts to discover the
way of it's moving, the principle of their engine operating were
fa i lures.

The necessity to have an additional information about this
object, it's technical characteristics and it's purposes was
reflected in the Air Force project called "Sign" in December 19t17.
For keeping strictly to the secrecy, connections between
the groups "Signtr and "MagesLic" were conducted by two persons in
the intellegence department of the rnaterial-technical aviation
office, whose role was restricted to transference of the
typical information according to the established channals. llithin
the framework of "Sigp" the project "HaIice" was founded in
December of l9{7. AII it's work was conducted under a code "Blue
book" by air-force officers at it's head.
0n November 5 1950 the second object probably very similar to
the first crashed to the ground at a very high rate after having
moved to a long trajectory in the atmoshpere, observed from the
Earth. It was at Al Indio-Guerrero in the region of Texas-Mexico
border,
Immidiately a trench-raid was sent to the place which found
only the fragments of the nearly completely burnt out apparatus.
The specimens of the materials were urgently conveyed to Sandia.
state New-Mexico.
It is important to the National Security that the motives and
purposes of these visits continue to be unknown. Besides that,
due to the observations, the activity of these objects began in
May and continues during the autumn of this yeaT and it is
expected the future development of these events.
Recogniz ing these reasons, the international and technological
importance of this probleru, and the necessity to avoid panic among
the population on alI levels, the group "Magestic" expresses it';
opinion, that precautions for
keeping the secrecy of this
information must be taken without initiating
the new
administration into it.
In the book of the abov"Xr".tioned Stringf ietd ',syndrorne of
in 1980, it was marked that 28 UFOs'
catastrophes were registered in the world lately, from which I?,
took place on the USA territory and 16 in other countries.
In l'larch 1950 all american press published articles about the
flight of mote than 500 disc-shaped UF0s above the nuclear
enterprises in New-Mexico /Adolf Shneider book "Visitors from the
Un i verse" , 1976/
From the mentioned book and also from the books: Fauler "UFOaI ien planet visitors", 1976; Burre "UFO: the army talks", 1979/
the following information became public. In September 1951 The
Committee of Staff Commandors /the highest rnilitary body in the
USA/issued secret directions "JANAP-1116" about measures to avert
the armed aggression against the USA, which ordered to inform
immediately about the appearance of unknown strategic means,
including UFO, by the military informational channals. In a case
a military man'divulged this information by radio or TV he was to
be imprisoned for 10 years and fined for 10 thousand dollars.
A whole serial of UFO flights above lJashington in July-August
of 1952 aroused the formation of the negative attitude towards UFO
from the official circles of the USA. During these monthes UF0s
appeared above.the american capilll 7 times, flying above it and
going away quickly when pursuit planes appeared, and then
returned again. The greatest air raid happened on the night of
August 13, when on the whole 68 objects appeared above the c iLV /

highest government and military circules of the USA, which
concerned these UFOs to be dangerous to the national security and
took precautionary measures. One of these measuTes was a secret
task to the Institute of applied sciences after Bettel to conduct
a deep analysis of all information about UFO from 1917 Lo 1952.
The results of these investigations lrere presented in a secret
report "Report N 1T", the workers of "Blue book" were forbidden
to cite /AIlen Hainek's book 'tHainek's report on UFO",1977/.
In September of I95Z the department of scientific
intelligence of the CIS prepared a secret memorandum, which
stressed the necessity of organiz ing a globaI system of
information collecting about UFO from all over the world in order

to stude this phenomenon seriously. To all this it was pointed
out that Air Defence Forces could have instructions to intercept
UF0s. One of the task was to find out, how seriously the Soviet
scientists worked on the problem and why data about UFO was
hushed up in the Soviet press, and also took measures of
desinformation in order to compromise the UFO problem in the
USSR /the second memorandum of...1980/.
In January of 1953 the CIS gathered in lJashington the
so-called "Robertson's Commission" which besides Director
Robertson, who'was a secret CIS worker, included also four
scientists connected with military industry, and some generals of
ADF and tepresentatives of the CIS ,/Jacob's book "Polemics about
UFO in the USA", 1975/ In the seventies the minutes of these
meetings were opened and it was known that the Director of CIS
Allen Dallas 1las present at them. The concluding report of the
Commission, prepared to the CIS directions was aimed at forming
the govetnmental policy in the question of UFO on aIl levels
including the President. Some recommendations wete given in the
report to abort free access of civilian people to the UFO
information, obtained by ADF, to conceal the reality of UFO
existance from the population and affirm that alI UFO
observations could be explained by usual reasons in older to
lessen the interest to the problem in the USA and other
countr i es.
In l'larch 195{ the directions "JANAP-ILI5 was issued again with
an index /c/. At that time it was pointed out in it that data
about alI unknown objects, including UF0s were to be passed as
the information of paramount irnportance. To aIl this it was
underlined that aIl the information of the kind was connected
wit"h the national security and divulging of this information in
any way was forbidden and would inflict penalty according to a
law of espionage. After issueing of the direct.ions pilots of
civi I ian aviation were also forb idden to divulge the information
about UFOs /Fauler "UFO- aIien planet visitors",1976/.
In March 1966 the Committee of the Staff Commanders issued
the fifth variant of "JANAP" directions with an index /e/, in
which it was pointed out that UF0s were to be considered as
hosti Ie objectives.
The ADF Staff issued a number of secret docurnents dealing
especially with UFOs. The First of them was a secret instruction
AFR N 2OO-2 written on August 26 1953 under which all researches
of UFO would be conducted in three organizations:
-intelligence office of ADF in Pentagon;
-airsquadron 11602 of scientific protection which had it's
representatives in all aviabasesl
-scientific-research centre of ADF at the base in Rite
Patterson. I
Even the highest officers of ADF were not allowed to get the
information about UFO and sound the results of the first stage of
investigations.
Fragments of "flying saucers" or detaiIs which could belong
to them, and pictures of radar screens showing the manoeuvres and
rate of UFOs, and original pictures of saucers were to be sent

the third time under the title "0perations and actions of UFO

LI. CONCLUSION
During the fulfilment of the first stage of the researches of
the theme I'Thread-3 the following main results have been obtained:
l. The scientifically-based conception of the researches of the
theme for the period from 1991 to 1995 has been formulated,
lJhile working out the conception of the work the continuity
of the researches of abnomal aelospace phenomena in the unterplay
with the condition of helio-geophysical activity and technical
factor conducted earlier has been maintained. Together with this
the main attention is paid to the reduct ion of the arears of
scientific work in comparison with foreign countries reseatches
of abnomal aerospace phenomena and to the development of the new
directions of lesearches based on the theoretical-experimental
researches of vatious versions of AAP, NPA under laboratory
conditions with application of methods of mathematical and
physical modeling in order to find out the possibility of use of
separate AAP features for the improvement of the technology of
new types of armament manufacturing and for the search of new
principles of movemenL in the atmosphere and vacuum.
The main parts of the resarch conception are general
scientific, methodical and organizational principles of
investigations of aerospace phenomena defied explanation from the
position of modern sciences. Among these principles are of the
most importance the principles of estimation of trustworthiness
of information and principles of reasonable treatment of
researches according to which only after exhausting aII physical
laws of coservation we can resoTt carefully to the formulation of
new scientific statements, new axioms and principles.
2. The new lines in investiqations of thl theme have been
determinedl
the research of the possible origin and rnechanisms of
processing of AAP and their influence on the work of various
technical devicesl
the research of the nature of the processes of functioning
of non-traditional propelling agents and teir interaction with
environmentl
the research of the possible nature of formated radiation and
functional physical fields and their interaction with environrnentl
the research of AAP, NPA, FR and FPF interaction with
biological objects and working out of necessaly precautionary
means.
3. The co-operative of
organizations-executors of
the
programme "Thtead-3" has been made:
t[/u 67917 has been defined as a head-executor of

the first

direction of tlle work, it's co-executors are:rn/u 03tqt, AFA after
Y. A. Gagarin, Irkutsk HMAIC, the Institute of Radiotechnique and
Electronics of the AS of the USSR, the Institute of Atmosphere
Physics of AS, the Institute of ecological analysis problems and
renascence at the Academy of creation;
as fat as the second direction is concerned, as it's head
executor the Centre of science-technical investigations and
introduction of the AS has been defined, it,s co-executors ale:
the Institute of sinenergetics of HSU, SIU "Red Star", the
Institute of Atomic Energy after L V. Kurchatov, CDEB of the
Ministry of atornenergetics industries of the USSR, SCC "Rino. of
the AS, the Central Institute of economy, information and control
systems of the l{inistry of Defence of thb USSR;
the Research-scientific Institute of Heating Processes has
been defined as the head executor of the third direction;
the MSIE "Druzhina" has been defined as the head executor of

'"= i;;"i#';[;;;iio.
or the trustworthness of the information
from foreing editions dealing with aIl lines of researches ASRI
of Complex Problems of SCST and AS has been defined.
t.The main principles of working out and analyzing of
obtained information and identification of abnomal aerospace
phenomena, and also their classification due to the formed ideas
about their physical origin have been elaborated. lJith regard to
estimaLion o
ished data of SArl's machine
which can be considered as a manufactured UFO has been made. But

the given data doesn't permit to explain the physical principle
of Sarl's effect, it's constructive peculiarities and the
interplay of the elements of the described machine. For realizing
the scale of the phenomena on the first sLage it was given the
utmost statistical estimation of physical fields /within the

frarnework of conservation laws/ which have good chances to lead to the
levitation of Sarl's machine, the first results of this work are
presented in Suppl iments.
For the explanations of the processes of the Sarl's machine
functioning, it was suggested to consider non-traditional ways of

it's levitation /throuhg the interaction of electro-magnetic and
stationary fields of acceleration with space-time cuTve, the use
of gravitation4l waves forming marked"channels" in space.
The inspection of constructive and technological aspects of
Sarl's machine permits to make a conclusion:
on the basis of the existed materials constructions with high
revolutions can be rnanufactured;

at present we have a nurnber of strong and firm magnetic
alloys which can be used for primary experiments.
For the further conduction of the investigations of Sarl's
effect and machine, it has been based the list of experimental
models, the most important of which is electro-dynamic
model and magnefic model, The description of working places and
equipment necessary for the experiment are presented.
5, It has been made the analysis and prognosis of the
development of expeTimental and technical investigations in a new
sphere of science and rotator gravitation. It has been shown that
there is a gap in our knowledge of gravitation, especially of
gravidynamic interactions, rotary gravitation, space curve, common
vacuum theory. It has been justified that on the first stage it
is necessaty to test experimentally first of aII the effect of
mgss changing of all rotating bodies, quantum and resonance
effects of rotary gravitation and the possible gravitational
connection between rotating objects.
7, The analysis of the information of formed radiation and
functional physical fields has been conducted. It has been noted
that at present the nature of FR and FPF hasn,t been found out,
and the work of the technical installations generating these
radiations and fields has not been justified scientifically. It
has been extended only the subjective feature of FR and FPF and
some constructive peculiarities
of
instrumentation for
generation, concentration and application of FR and FPF.
The u3qilqrslepton tlreory" of- A.F.0chatrin has come under
)
doubt. T
ents dealing with
i the effect ofr msgns1l. and other physical fields on biosystems
have been made. The method of the tackling the problem dealt
with precautionary means and the prograrnme of workinq out these
precauLionary means has been elaborated.
I
9. The analysis of the information on foreign experience in
the investigations of the problems of abnomal phenomena and their
interaction with environment. It
is shown that these
investigalions are connected with the attempts of the scientists
abroad ,/USA, France/ to find out new forms of energy, new
principles of transference in space and vacuum and to create new

Here is a copy of an pofficial report on UF0- flight over the city of
Naltchik (South of Russia)
THE INFORMATION

on the investigation and analysis of the trajectory of the
flight and the shape of UFO which flied over the territory
of Kabardino-Balkarian Republic of the USSR,on the 13th of
February 1989.

1. The facts of UFO appearance above the city of Nalchik.
13th of February at 20 o, clock Popov Maxim, a
schoolboy of the school n. t and Muft"iev Denis, a schoolboy of the
school n.30 noticed sonre phenomena in the region of the Shalushka
river. The place where Popov M. stood is drawn in the pic.1. He
was standing wilh his friends when their attention was attracted
by a large red object situated high above the city. It was
noticed that the object was moving and losing height.
Then not changing the shape and the direction of it, s movement,
the object changed it's colour into red during several seconds.
After having changed it's colour the object went to six drops of
the same gleen colour situated on one horizontal line, with equal
intervals between them, The whole process took 10 minutes, After
this period of time, they changed their colour into red and
merged all together in one red circle. After that the object
passed out of sight.
The analogous phenomanon and at the same time was observed
by Muftiev Denis, and some minutes later by Chechenov Hurat, a
schoolboy of the school number 9,who was near the Republican
Palace of pioneers.
Then at about 2L3O-2Z00 an UFO appeared above the city, It
was observed by several hundred of citizens accoding to
preliminary data. The trajectory of it's flight and it's shape
(general look) is given in the picture 2 and 3.
According to the analysis to the witnesses descriptions the
trajectory of the UFO ftight above Nalchik was defined and it was
made a draft of it.
As it was described by the witnesses the object was about 150
( metres long and about {0 metres across. There were about B
windows of rectangular shape, the size if which diminished to
the tail part. It was a not very long Iight followinq it.
\ The windows (if they were windows) itluminated brightly, in the
front part there were two scanning projectors. The front part was
I slightly
inclined. There were no distinct descriptions of the
tail part.It flied noiselessly at a speed of 100 km per hour, at
\ a height of 100 m, above the earth.
( The object entered the city from
the village Kenzhe,
then flied above Golovko street, turned to Lenin pospecL, flied
along the railway frclm Alexandrovka to Nartan, turned back, flied
above the airport, then between Strelka and Kenzhe, and turned in
the direction of the town of Baksan. According to the witnesses
words the object flied in the direction of Baksan losing height,
it was supposed that it could have landed in the region of Kenzhe
-Kamenka. In order to prove this version the region of the
possible landing was examined by the car on the 15th and by the
helicopter on 'the 16th. 0n the zllth it was also made a
radioact.ive examination of the streets above which the object
flied. The radio-activity along the trajectory of the flight
wasn't higher the usual level.
After the object went away from the city, another one
appeared. It was smallet, more mobile and manoeuvring.It was seen
at about 2{ o,c}ock in the region Molodizhnuy, It flied low above

CONCLUSION

l.The analysis and generalization of the existing to the

beginning of {.his work facts of abnomal atmosphere-and space
phenomena has proved that the problem of their investigation atracts

attention of the general public, scientists, military specialists
and represents a subject of discussions and publications
2. The investigations conducted in nll 67917 were the first
attempt to identify on the scientific basis the

phenomena with

observed

aeronautic objects flights, artificial cloud
formations, flights and tests of rocket-space objects and other
technical equipment, manifestation of known natural phenomena or
their mutual influences. This intercommunication has been exposed
on the basis of the reseatches of more then 700 cases of reliable
information on abnomal phenornena observed by eye-witnesses in the
period from June 1978 to the I of July 1983.
3. The distinctive features of abnomal phenomena peculiar to
different regions of the country, including the regions where
science-technical experiments and tests of special programmes
had taken place, were exposed.
T.According to the witnesses' reports it can be established
the fact of rocket launchings and also their time and number At
more pTecise instrumental observations of the process of examined
phenomena development or it's separate fragments it's possible to
establish the type of rocket fuel (solid or liquid), the nurnber
of stages, the period of their work, the material composition of
the nozzle of the rocket engine and other characteristics of the
engine installation, because such features as intensity and time
of luminescence, the structure of it are
determined by the technical characteristics
of the engine
i sta I lat i ons.

Purposeful collection and tesearch of such information gives

the possibility,according to some observed effects, to judge of
the character and content of techical models, which allows a
probable enemyrto use this information for intelligence.
5. In the arrangements for
foreign technical
intelligence counteraction in the time of armament tests and
important sc ience-technical
exper iments
the
attendant
effects manifestation must be taken into consideration. The
corlect choice of the time and atrnosphere conditions can promote
secretiveness of the tests of especially important armament
specimen or reinforcement of the specific effects which accompany
sc ient i f ic exper iments,
5.The continuing attempts to organize wide discussions in the
press about possible reasons of the origin and development of
observed phenomena under the motto of UFO investigations can
favour the flowing off of very important information. In
connection with this the search and examination of the reports on
abnomal phenomena in atmosphere and space and also nonqualified
explanation of
them
public
by
oTganizations and
individuals-enthusiasts is undesirable.
At the sarne tirue, the scientific explanation of new
phenomena and effects in scientific-technical
and other special
editions wiII help to dethrone the myth about existing permanent
danger and threat of UFO.
In the most of researched cases the reason of appearance and
development of phenornena are explained within the limits of known
effects or connected with scientific-technical experiments or
tests of technical equipment, some atmosphere processes and their
mutual influence ( interference).
7. On the whole the problem is worth futher reseaTch and
closely connected with the problems of the Earth atmosphere and

investigations of the nature and property of aLnomal phenomena is
necessary for extending our knoledge of air and space means
functioning in order to ensure the safety of their flights.
q.The experience in identification of abnomal phenomena and
based on science methods of the research of their nature and
origin allow to nalrow considerably the circle of phenomena
subject to study and to determine the aims and tasks of the

further invest i gat ions.
The results of the

identification of the above-mentioned
phenomena elicited a fact of other similar processes and effects
which can't be identified because of the lack of complementary
data about scientific-technical experiments and test of technical
equipment in

different regions of the country and the
impossibility to achieve effective information about observed
during the tests atmosphere and space phenomena. The process of
appealance and development of such phenomena can also be
connected with different geophysical processes and other unknown
effects or their mutual influence.
The results of
further investigations wi Il find their
reflection in the future editions of the Information materials.

I have already mentioned provokative questions that .tlalishev
was asked. Here is one of them: "Tolya, when you aske8-._-'fhero
guestions, did they understand you immediately?" The answer: "Lev

Fyg.lievich, often I hardly had time to ask a question, only to
think about it, and t.hey already answered."And about such details
it was written only in foreign uFO literature, which was
difficult to get only if you had good "connections", and it was
necessary to translate it.

Kostrikin Viktor Petrovich was botn in L927 near Astrakhan.
As it has been'mentioned his first contact took place on July 7
1958. Having summarized the information got duiing his contacts
he wrote a considerable and convincing in some places report. He
called it "Behind the verge of mystery". The extract from this
book are set below:
untiI I saw it
"Before 1962 I believed UFO very Iittle,
myself at the surnmer august night. . . in the vi I lage of
Blagoveshenka of Prohladnenski region in Kabardino-Balkaria. .
UFO was moving by strange z igzag trajectory. .
IJhen I was a chi ld my grandmother often told me: "Grandson,
Iook often at the sky and you will see a miracle, something is
flying there". UFO was observed as by my grandmother and my
mother also... at the niqht on JuIy 7 1968 I got to the
mountain village Khushtosirt of Chegem region, I went up to
Alpine meadows. I chose this region because f saw UFO flights
here not seldom. I settled on the haycock. . . It was about 3 a. m.
Suddenly I saw a vertically falling meteor of unusual brightness.
Then this
brightness disappeared and further I ifting down
continued very near and was accompanied by smoky "waggings"...
Si lence. . . I was concentrated. And thenf very near to rne from a
small forest I felt an inspiring fear look. In one moment I left
my observation post and ran away... But I was stopped. I was
paralysed. I could neither move my leq nor raise my aTm... The
cold sweat stood out on my face. My heart beat fast, my mind
worked, But soon constraint and fear disappeared... I
heard
somebody calling me and went. Behind a small hillock a huge diskshaped metallic light coloured apparatus was standing.Along it's
perimeter port-holes illuminated. Only when I approached to it I
realized that there were not port-holes but round opened outlets of
tubes. There were no port-ho1es as in our notion at all in it.
The tubes went inside the apparatus along radius, and outside
they i lluminated with a specif ic I ight of mi Ik tint. This strange
Iight rounded the apparatus in some places. The irnpression was
if the apparatus was in a liqht cocoon.
f was met by a creature vety similar to me: the same legs,
the same arms. It was of the sarne height or a bit higher. His
clothes was light, and his head and hands were inlluminating,
especially visible outside the apparatus. The figure was very
slender with normal proportions, movements were very staid and
even sublime. They didn't like loud conversations with much
gesticulation. They gave me a siqn to enter. f crossed the
threshold, whete it ended the power of rnoney and any earth power.
There was a kingdom of a word and deed there. The absolute
super i or ity.

electric, more like usual day light. There-were not sharp shadows
in apartments. The light iame- from above, I didn'L saw the
sautces of it. I noticed some other figures, five of them. All of
them were dressed in similar clothes and were alike as twin
brothers... Their heads were large, faces were oval and oblong,
attractive and specific /there are not bad pictures made by
Kostrikin-L,ch./. The impression was that when thly looked at you
they knew eoen what you thought /remember l'talishev's
answet-L,Ch. /
They were neither hostile nor especially curious.The most
pgcgliar their eyes were. They were large
and wide-set. It seemed
that they saw equally everything - in front of them and
sideways. This wide view frightened very much. . . I didn't see
anybody wearing glasses. Th"y blinki:d very seldom /read
t'lalishev's report/. There was something of a bird in their eyes
and look. Heads were crowned by something made of gold and
jewelry /it is not improbable that Kostrikin took something for
gold and jewelry-L.Ch. / From behind it looked like a skull-cap,
from the front and sides a fore-and-aft cap. . . they had no
decorations, herns and even buttons /iL is a characteristic
feature mentioned by many people being in contacts-L. ch. / There
weTe something I ike folds at the ends of sleeves, trousers and
near a neck. Their clothes were white and brilliant. Their shoes
were with thick as rnicrocellular soles... They had hair which
seemed to be gTey, though their faces had no wrinkles and looked
very young.
I introduced myself saying that I was a native of the Caucasus
and at the same rnoment I received an answer that onlv four
nationalities were native, and others were strangers or mixed.
They enumerated them. They had their own ni*es for these
nationalities and only one word sounded as our "svani". They even
showed their locations.
They called themselves neither gods nor devi ls, they only
_
eschange looks to my question which seemed to be irrelevint foi
them,
In their speech with sornebody they used unusual rneans of

;::flil:i?li:1,".1:i
fingers, I turned

o{,,"=
and bent my head, neverthelesi I heard, The
direction of the source of sounding was fixed and didn't change
when your position changed. . . Their answers,/to the questions/ weie
cleat, accutate, without too many words, in the -modern russian
t91guage. They were very polite. Their voices were young and
and

differed in timbres. Their emotional condition was felt and
apprehended by tones. They I iked good humour. 0f course they
didn't laugh. Llhen they talked with me without opening theii
lips, So it was a straight language thought strictly oriented by a
correspondent. . . Between themselves they used an unknown lanquage.
I was sitting in an armchair and- again my attention was
attracted by an original rectangular table above the entrance to
another section made of gold and decorated with semi-precious
stones. . . shining dots resembled a starry sky. I asked- what it
was. I'Def ine yourself". "In my opinion, it
is a restrictive
instrument or a stop-signal". "rt is right. IJhen the largest
stars are in this position, very imp.ortant events wiII take place

Then two t'twins" came up to me. One of them wore black qloves
which reached his elbows. . . his hands were very elegant. . . The
gloves suited him well as if had been made especially for him,
There were no wrinkles or foldes on them. rt's quality was surprig!.9: There was no polish or specks on them. They were absolutely
black. I looked at them with fear and watchfulness. I thought
what they were going to do. They took my left hand and turned it
with the edge up, unbent my thumb and put an instrument between

piece of my skin appeared on the instrument.
A red triangle appeared on my hand. I
felt no pain, there was no blood on my hand. And at the same time
this small wound began to skin over before my eyes.., the black
gloved hand began to penetrate into my chest. I watched this
miraculous deed with rny eyes wide opened. There were no obstacles
for this glove, no sceleton, no muscles, no clothes. I felt no
pain or other unpleasant feelings. 0nly when the glove was deep
enough and touched my heart I uttered a scleam with pang. The
glove got out, There srere no traces or blood at the place of
a

it's penetration. It was beyond human understanding!
...I was afraid to ask, how to explain such transforruations,
but wondered what they needed my skin for. They answered that it
was a large sautce of information. That from the small piece of
skin they could make several human figures. That people began to
injure their cover, and their organism. That for future
generations this cover would not function proper, and their
organisn would not be up to the requirements. Influences of the
enviroNment rose
yearlyr radioactive,
chemical,
vibrational, informational which were not seen at the time, would
be fatal in future. The date of this future was under their
control... They took these probes regularly not only from people
all over the world but from animals also. That the large genetic
fund was renovating and replenishing constantly...
LIhi le visiting our planet they treated everything with care
though they were often attacked. They tried to do their best to
minimize the number of victims of such meetings.
Then I was sitting in the same arm-chair and remember everything
as in a dream. They brought a black rectangular instrument to my
eyes. A blue even light began to creep out of the corners of my
eyes. Rolling my eyes I could see even light. Then they examined
my birth mark, and found another on the forehead, above the
bridge of the nose. I never paid attention to it.
I didn't know the purpose of this examination.
I said that they were probably living somewhere not far from us.
The answer was approximately I ike that. Not only in the
neighbourhood but far, farer and farer. That theTe was a large
starry inhabited"country", bordering with our Galaxy, that
there was a coTridor between them, that on theiT way to us they
replenish reserves of water. That they not only drank
\ could
water, but it could burn slowly and be a fuel for large
space-crafts resembling crystals. That their lives were much
i longer then ours.Our= Iife was only a mrnsle__-ef._!hejJ. That all
ear{h civilization
,^,hi"h *.= linked
to great cyclBs and rhythms of astronomical character /the same
idea was presented in the ancientegypt philosophy of Germes
Trismegistr, which is very difficult to find. Later the idea was
presented in many philosophical schools of ancient India. In aII
contacts when a question about the theory of"Great explosion". or
"Pulsating Universe" was asked the answer was synonymous, that it
is one of
the rnankind's delusions. So "astronomical
rhythms"mentioned by Kostrikin are not to be identified with
"Great explosion"-L. Ch. /
And the development of their civilization was not connected
with these factors and was renained owing to the force of
knowledge. That we /earth men/ not waiting for great cycles were
ready to annihi Iate everything on the Earth by our large nuclear
potential, this fact worried them and attracted their attention,
it was a different, unabated control and their reaction would be
immediate, with the speed of a thought /?//Look at Malishev's
story/if it was necessary...
Then Kostrikin regained consciousness in the morning on July
7 aL a large distance from the place where he had been. He
thouqht that if he had been even unconscious, he was not able to
cross high mountains and rapid rivers and be in dry clothes.

iniorm scientists about my contact were failure. -r only Llashed
with rnisunderstanding and ill-will towards me.
At last drawing by a inesistible desire, I again went to my
haven near the village of Khyshtosirt on July 7 aL- l0 p.m. and
everything was repeated as it was in the summer of 1968.
"There was nobody near a disc-shaped apparatus. . .pi lots were
not inside either. A quiet bewitching music was heard... I came
into the craft-nobody. At that moment I saw an entrance to the
neighbouring section. I went there.. . Then I heard a peremptory
hroman's voice: "There is nobody there"...I vras terrified.
I
turned baclt and saw an opened book...
The signs in this book were in columns and resembled our
stenographic signs. I didn't turn over pages. I started to
compare the signs with known objects and animals... I asked what
two of them rneant and remenbered. Open maps of the starry sky
were near... I felt distinctly that I was under observation, but
saw nobody. Arsign which I called a "tobacco pouch" attracted my
attention by it's originality. I asked pointing to it: "TeIl me
please, what does this sign mean?" "It is an inhabited part of the
Universe", In the text I saw many crosses which vrere depicted in
different ways.. I was interested in it and I asked a question
about the meaning of these crosses. "These are astronomical
symboIs... It /astronomical ideogram/contains the number of

collisions, intersections of galaxies taking into account
commensurability. Then I drew my attention to the sign which I
ca I led a"crocod i lett.
-please, this sign Iooks like a crocodile, and it resembles
something very unpleasant.
-it
is a symbol of
life and designates two joining
ga lax i es.
-excuse my rnisunderstanding. But I think that when two
galaxes ate joining it's a symbol of deaLh, but not a symbol of
life.
- it's right but not totally. Galaxies are striving for
rapprochement and after large periods of time they join in pairs.
Then death, destruction, creation and exchange take place. Then
they move away/from each other/. Such is Great l,lother Nature...It
was, is and will be for ever.
- and that is an explanation for such variety of stars from
giants to dwarfs in our galaxy,
- not exactly...
- but when galaxies join
it
is
followed by
blows: gravitational, heatirrg. . . and so on and how can we save a
life?
-that's the problem and try to solve it. Imagine that very
long ago a life appeared somewhere and started to develop. It has
passed all the stages of evolution and reached the highest level
of mind. . . the gained knowledge and experience was shared
with descendants.

t, I'leetings with UFO in around planetary orbits.
In the above mentioned round-table talk in the editorial
office of r'.I'Komsomolskaya P?avdail M. L. Popovich reported the
following . . when American astronaul Armstrong came in the town
of Zvezdniy, I came up to him and said, that I had heard a lot
about your meetings with UF0, TeIl us please about them. But if
you had been warned not to tell us about this, say please
immidiately. But he answered: "Even if I was suggested a million
dollars, I shouldn't deny the fact that I had seen, because it is
very interesting and I deal with this. I saw, honestly I saw! "he said.
Then Marina Leontievna continued: "I have a duplicate of the
tape nf the report of the space-craft stuff - cosmonuats
Kovalenok and Ivanchenko- about UFO. 0n June 17, 1978 at 0.11
a. m. they were on the second turn around the Earth, -KevraJenok
reported to the Centre of control something very n6ar t6-TFe*
following: "Here is the information for you to think about. 0n the
right, at an angle of 30 degrees there is an object flying under
us"- Silence. The Earth: "Describe the appearance and shape of the
object. " Kovalenok: "Itis something very much like a tennis balI,
bright as a f laring up star't. Ivanchenko: "It's rate Iower than
ours". And here is the next extract from M.L.Popovich's repolt:
0n March Z+ 1978 in "Vechetnaya lloskva" in correspondent
Zhelesnovats reporting an interview with cosmonauts Romanenko and
In
Grechko was published. The interview is very diffuse'
conformity witH our conversation I want to single out the
following: During two turns atound the Earth they wele followed
by UF0, and according to cosmonauts' information, the object was
much more than any known launched from the Earth object in
size(!) The object was as Lhough metallic, as it was scetched by
Romanenko, it was glittering in the sun rays.?l

Yuri Gagarin at his visit to Iton in England at the reception
said the following:rrDuring my flight I saw something more besides

permition to say about this, th whole world will be astonished".
And radio Vienna broadcasted on April 21 1967 the following
information: I'Cosmonaut Gagarin has reported, that flying saurces
are real objects, which fly at a velocity of light. They present
a problem of paramount impottance, which must be investigated. ".
The second Soviet cosmonaut German Titov also saw strange
luminous objects following his space-craft in outer space.
The f ifth Soviet cosmonaut Valeri i Bikovskv on {unsl8o--l96l
saw an object which he f irstly tffiine

then he noticed that it was an egg-shaped object. UFO followed
Bikovsky's space-craft for rather a long time and then suddenly
changed the direction of it's f light.
Even in l9tl8 while launching the rocket FAU-Z from the firing
ground Uhite Hender, a disc flying at the rate of 1800 km,/hour
apperared near the rocket. It was making circles around the

rocket. It was observed with binoculars, telescopes and on

has been already mentioried the report of
at. the round-table meeting, organizLd by
"Komscrmolskaya Ptavdat'on I'larch 21987, And here is the report of
another participant of this meeting, scientific worker of the AS
USSR Listratov Anatolv Pavlovich:
t'
ing to narrate resembles pure
criminal inquest. An anonymous letter was sent to one of the
magazines' editirial board in summer of 1979. It read near the
following: You are writing fantastic stories about meeting with
alien planets' visitors, and we have had such a contact in our
town. Then facts, names, offices were presented. .. This letter
fell into my hands...At that time there was a program dealing
with the problem(?) in the Academy of Sciences, it's head was...
Narimanov Georgy Stepanovich /academician from the Institute of
spaceTeBearches -L. Ch. / After a long search I managed to find
people having investigated this event, and after 11 monthes I
Ieft for this place and learnt aII this... I managed to find all
eye-witnesses of this phenomenon and to talk with them.lJe had the
authorities of the Academy of Sciences... - two representatives- I
and a worker of the Institute of space tesearches. , . He wre sent
to the division. . . of rocket troops. . lJe had appTopTiate documents
and the Ministry of Defence rendered us support in conducting
investigations. This event took place in a small town of
Derzhavinsk /Kazakhstan, Turgai region,/ consisting of two parts:
an open part and a close mi I itary town. As the town was very
small the information spread all over the town quickly and was
investigated on the level of The Regional Party Committee, and
Regional Security Committee. .
The essence of the story is as follows: on-June_-Z_197? a

group of pioneers /from the pioneer camp "Berezka"/ went for a
walk. They went to the mound "Lisaya",.. Suddenly some of the
boys noticed a flash not far from the forest's edge on the mound's
summit After ha short period of time... they noticed some
constructions as slate tents on the same edge,., and saw a group

under hypnosis. They started to cry, waved their hands inviting
them to come up. . , But hypnosis went away quickly, when they saw
that people were unusual. They were qiants, y,gry thin, slender,

the
mound . . . Uhen the boys ran they heard snappingof twigs from the
both sides of the road. llhen the chi ldren ran out in a steppe
they saw on one side three figures accompanying them... The boys
described these people in different ways, and it was natural. But
the main

snrnrnq e]gs, vely easy step,

as if for balance.
To all this they stepped as if plunging in o the ground. ,. The
boys saw them at the nearest distance of 5-6 metres. The boys
were not much afraid, but ran as quickly as they could, and the
accompanying group lessened in number, firstly there were two of
them left, and then the boys were followed by one. lJhen the boys
reached the carnp, they stopped and their"petsuer'stopped too
hesitating. The boys grew bolder and started to cry inviting him
: "Come, come, be our guest!'r But he turned out and went back,
glanced back several times, and then disappeared as if dissolved.
And that is not the end of the story. The boys were very much
excited and couldn't sleep during quiet hours, they ran to see,
what was going on in the steppe. In the evening the second event
took place on the territory of the camp. That time it happened
with the youngerst group. The chi ldren were going from the
canteen to their sleeping rooms,., on the right side of the path
there was a chair. An accordionist accompanying the morning
exercises always sat on this chair in the morning.,. So a girl
of about eight was going in advance fnllowed by an educator of
this group. Suddenly the girl rushed forward with a wild scream;
the educator following her saw'ra huge ghost"sitting on the chair
turning to her, , . She also was frightened and took to her heels.
Later aII elders which were in the camp were collected and
started to comb the camp's territory. They found nothing, but one
of the boys, afi eye-witness to the daytime event, who was on duty
that day at the kitchen, said that he was coming back with two
pails of water and at the moment saw a giant figure passed him
sw i ft Iy.
Among material traces we can mark the following: a chair with
metallic legs on which the giant sat was half digged in the
ground, and soil was very firm there, And as it rained in the
morning, it was damp and the imprints of aproximately half meter
feet were left on the ground.
AII this is approved by documents, reports and tapes... the
work was conducted under the leadership of the Regional Party
Committee, and Regional and District Security Committees.. . at the
night before the above described event an UFO flight and hang were
observed...the boys which contacted, inspite of the fact that 11
monthes had passed were very much excited, I had many talks with
them in various situations. They were asked cross-questions and
so on... after two days of our arrival rumouts were afloated that

to tell us anything to avoid troubles... The commander of the
Staff, who was functioning at the time as a commander of the
division told us about some events taking place in the division
disposit ion, also on the same level of fantasy. . . I have no
reasons not to trust eye-witnesses, especially in those cases
when eye-witnesses wele children... children couldn't tell lies.
Could they devise a tale and narrate it together ?.. and also
induce their edicator in their t'adventurous p1an"?

Here is a short story of it with stylistic correction.
f was born in 1957 in the region of Fergana, I was about 6-7
when the firsL "nreeting" took place. I walked at the edge of our
settlement and suddenly noticed a disc-shaped apparatus at 200
metres distance from rne. Three figures in diving-dresses were
approaching me, they were of middle height, I was frightened and
I ran away.Since 1965 I have been living in Solnechnogorsk district
of Moscow tegion, where I had my second contact. Before this
event I heard and read nothing about UFO. In my youth I was inte-

rested in drawing.
0n July 2l 1975 it rained heavily in the morning, but at
about 5 p.r. the weather changed and I went to the forest to
draw the sunset. I was vely nelvous, though there wete no reasons
for it. I went for about three km. from my house and found a
glade, where I settled.
I had never been before to this place, This place was
situated about one and a half kilometre from the village Kostino.
I was deeply concenttated, the feeling of anxiety grew acute. It
was about I p. m. I turned back. And I saw at 80 m. ftom me a
silver disc-shaped
apparatus. It's diametet was about 13 metres,
it's height - tt mefetes, It's perimeter was a shining ring. Three
human beeings came out of it and came up to me. They were in
silver diving-dresses;their height was about 1.70 m., they were
about 25, two figures of men and one woman. Their faces were vely
attractive, oblong; their eyes were elongated and differ in
colour. They went synchronously, easy, as in a slackened fi lm.
I was not ready to this meeting and naturally the feeling of
fear grew sharper. They understood this. The woman stretched out
her hand and said smiling with testrait: "Good day. Don't be
afraid of us. lle have come from another planet. IJhat are you
doing?" I answeted: "I am making a scetchr'. They looked at me very
attentively, blinking -.seldom, which made their look more
perspicacious. They didn't
take their helmets off. I heard the
voice of pleasant timbre not clearly I
not wi-aIl
at the fact
people being in contacts mention, and
ishev had no
idea about it-L. Ch. / I saw their lips rnoving as if talking. Each
of them had either an instrument or a tound ernblem on the right
side of their chest. One of them brought a rectangular instrument
to me, an antenna moved out of it. Then he took the instrument
away. They suggested me to go into the apparatus. The woman went
in advance, the men went after her holding my shoulders, ilhen we
reached the disc we were as if pulled into the apparatus. Inside
an even liqht lit up the rows of blinking instruments. 0nly the
central part of the apartment was seen and the rest was in haze.
There was a round table and some places for sitting in it, I was
suggested to take a sit and undress. I was confused, but'began to
carry out their request. The woman realized my condiLion and
disappeared in a liqht haze, as in the scteen of a switched off
TV set. They fastened detectors to my hands and legs, and put on
my head something like a crown. After examining their rnade a
conclusion: very specif ic /strong./ nervesl mental faculties below
the average,/Malishev as a vely honest and ingenuous man repeated
the last estimation word for word - that was one of the evidences
of thruthfulness of his words*L.Ch. /
They were surprised at my body. I said that I went infor sports,
they asked "Uhat's this?'r I : ?'It's a physical labour".
They showed to me an instrument,which was very like our TV set,
There was one of lhe streets in Solnechnogorsk, which was about
12 km, from this place, in the screen. People and cats - closeup. Then they took me out of the apparatus and returned in it.
For 2-3 seconds they lifted an apparatus at one km.height the
ring about the disk changed it's colour from blue to bright white
apparatus hung and opened in I sectors / as orange sections/.
Then turned into a cylinder /sausage/, Then returned to it's

wiII take t0 min. to fly to our planet and
the same to return. The distance is about 3 light yearsil The
author of these lines being aware that the neatest star to us r^ras
situated at a distance of 1.3 light years was one of the first
among those who interviewed Malishev and asked a question:'rTolya,
is their sun alike ours?r', anticipat ing beforehand his exposure.
He gave an answer /not word for word/: - "I saw no sun there,
the planet was lit up by a garland of highly situated very bright
lamps. and also by some illumination from inside".
- Upward flight, A porthole opened - the sight of the moving
away Earth. IJe sat in the armchairs the same as in air-crafts,
The diving-dresses had been taken off. On the wornan's head there
was something like a hat. She took it off, she had fluffy
light-chestnut coloured hair. After some time they showed to me the
Earth from outeT space. Our starl from the Earth was accompanied
with a sound ,ttu-u-ur? with the rise of frequency. Ue weTe
approaching the Moon. In the same porthole, which appeared only
during the Cosmos demonstrations, I saw the approaching Moon,
some hangar constructions. They explained that those were their
stations /look : "Abnomal phenomena on the Moon"/Further we flied
as if behind the l'toon /according to Halishev's word-around the
corner to the left -L.Ch./During the fIight I felt very unpleasan
which is very difficult to describe in words. They realized that
and changed somehow the atmosphere inside, that my unpleasant
feelings disappeared.The woman asked with a smile: "Maybe you
want to eat?" I answered: "If you have something'l
They gave rne a salad, as a mixtute of different vegetables and
our minetal water "Borzhomi". Their food was pure vegetarian. IJe
drew to their planet. [Je came out, Even white light, the saurce
was not seen /besides the above-mentioned lamps/. The air was
clean, fresh as in a pine-forest far from cities. It was a bit
easier to move there as on our Earth. The covering of the ground
was very similar to our concrete. There vtere some people standing
around us, I remember the clothes on two persons: one was in a
sport suit and the other in dark trousers and a white shirt. I
went accomanied only by one. I had in my memory stone soi I, grass
very similar to our, there were cupola-shaped and prism-shaped
buildings and iIluminatinn as if from inside them there. There
were rtsaulcesrr f Iying above the surface of the 'rplanet". Isawa
f lying f igure with folded arrns.
IJe found ouselves in a bui ldin 9. tJhile moving along it walls
were dispersing. A large haII. A scteen ZxZ n. Creatures with
dark skin were in it.
It was a conversation between Lhem and one of those present.
Their speech resembeled whistle, and sometimes it was like man's

of separated vibrating shreds. I felt horror in their ptesence,
but then calmed a I ittle.
They put on their diving-dresses in the following way: they
coveted themselves with something, and came out already dressed.
They undressed as followers: they raised their hands and their
suit divided into two parts r:n the waist level, then the upper
part of the suit lifted up and laid down near, then they jumped
up and the lower part slid down. They also demonstrated

I saw how a man arose from a luminious dot: it was spreading
in all sides forming a man /by the woyr

Kostorikin, a man being in contact described the similar
appearinng of a being. Kostorikin Iives in Nalchik, he had his
first contact on July 7 L968. It has been stated that these two
people knew nothing about each other*L. Ch. /
A man disappeared very quickly. They showed the process in
stages: 1/ a man 2/ illuminating contour and inside a dark
silhouette 3/ a dark silhouette 4/ a luminuous dot /that the way
how the woman disappeared, when Malishev was going to undtess.
In one of his pictures Malishev described the stages of a man's
d i sappearance/.

He saw also a 6ook. He saw an animal very much like an elk. He
saw something very like a tape recorder: a triangle prism and
a disk. Our broadcasts were tecorded on it. They also showed
pictures of our earth towns, air and space crafts. He saw crea*
tures of I m. height: elongated alms, greenish faces.
/such detahles about hypothetical biorobots were not known at
that time, and Malishev described, he had only middle education,
practically never left his village and read books very seldom as
his parents said, aII his spare time he drew-L. Ch. ./
He was introduced to a man, who had lived in Moscow for about
20 years in 30-10 th. From the conversation with him I understood
that the man knew Moscow very well.
I tried to take a I iquid paral lelepiped, as a material
evidence of being in this space craft. Not turning back /a stranget was slanding with his back to Malishev/ordered to put it in
it's place.They suggested him to stay with them gor ever, he

refused.
They said, that wouldn allow thermo-nuclear wal on the Earth,
and in the extreme case, they would"blocade" alI electric

chains on military objects so nobody would inderstand what the
matter was /remember the most imnrense energetic damage, which
spread from New-York to Mein on the north-east of the USA with

Evidences of truthfulness of Malishev's contact.
Some evidences have already been presented in the

story, and

here are additional.
As soon as Malishev was "discovered?'by a group of Moscow
UFOloqists, the representatives of this group were sent to him,

N.Nosov. They / lo the surprise of the group and to Malishev in
first tutn, who came in the I'tai l" of the group/brought the group
exactly to the landing place, and exactly pointed to all three
landing places, Further specialists in dowsing confirmed these
places.
Malishev was hypnotized and in the presence of witnesses he not
only confirmed, what he told before but added some intersting
details which he couldn't recollect before. His hypnothetical
sleep was so deep that the hypnotizer had to cry questions

several times. For exarnple: "Tolya! ilhy don't they start rnass
contacts now?r' scarcely noticed movement of the lips and hardly
heard answel: "They are waiting.., " Hypnotizer: "Hhat are they
waiting for? Tolya! IJhat are they waiting fot?" MaI ishev: "I don't
know. "
One of Moscow UFologists was several times at

the place of
this contact, and also examined the surroundings. Once he was in
a military unit dislocated not far from the place. He was told
that one of military men of this unit had also have a contact not
long before, and fIiqhts of "saurces't were observed in these
places very often. The author of these lines - a specialist in
aviation, spent several nights at a bonfire specially on the
"Malishev's glade" and observed UFO twice: the first fIight was
Iow above the forest by a sinusoidal trajectory and another time
it was a hangipg of a bright-blue UFO at 850 m.distance.

{
I. V. Stal in having been informed about the home and abroad
statistics of UFO appearances, entrusted S. P. Korolev to deal with
these data, as Korolev was charged with other important
"missions" at the time and knowing that these UFOs might get him
into trouble, he managed to refuse.,, And the problem hung poised

in mid air... near hanging 'rsaucersr'.
Some enthusiasts such as
A. P. Kazantzev,
Y. V. Rosz ius,
became
V. V. Rubzov, A. A, Tikhonov, P. A. Stolyarov,
F. Y. Zegel
interested in the problem,
Especially I want to speak well of the late FeIix Yurievich
Zegel He was an asttonomer by his education and gLauled-'fo
invdstioate UFO _in 1955.and continued his work surrending himself
,

st days of his life /December ZO'1988/.
this problem,
organized public collectives of investigators, took part in alI
senrinars^L conf'erences dedicated to the UFO problem. He delivered
lectures, investigaled the UFO landing places and other material
evidence, coltesponded with
leading UFOlogists all over the
world and leaders of public UFO organizations, he received
publications dealing with UFO from abtoad, he addressed to alI
instances trying to prove the reality and paramount importance of
the problem. It is hard to enumetate all his services. Felix
Yurievich had much difficulties in his work and overcame many
obstacles. They also tried to threaten him. He was an author or
co-author of the first serious articles about UFO in this country.
in the magazines "Smena" n 7,1967, "Youth Techniquerr n 8,1967,
"Baikal" n t and "Vokrug sveta" n 1,1968,
He and Major*General P, A, Stolyarov had an opportunity to
take part in a TV proglam on November l0 T967.
Thousands of people responded to this program. To the special p/b
letters, pictures and drawings made by observers weTe sent to
them.
People separated by long distances, people of various ages
and professionE wrote about one and the same. The most valuable
were the letters and even radiograms from cTews of air*crafts,
naval depots, members of geological detachments and constructing
brigades. All these documents wete in the basis of the first three
manuscripts of Zegel "UFO observations in the Soviet Union".
It was also some leports about mass UFO observations during
the Patriotic Uar.
The reports from the civilian pilots about their UFO
observations during their regular flights wete Lo be sent in the
State Scientific Research Institute of Civilian Aviation. Many
telegrams were received by
the Genetal Control of
Hydrometeoservice of the USSR. Some information was also received
by the Astrosociet of the Academy of Sciences. But every chief
took care of his post and concealed this information in their
safes.
Since 1956 Y. A. Fomin, a teacher of the automation department
of the Moscow Institute of Food Industries, began to systematize
foreign information of UFO and collect dala about UFO
observations in the USSR. In 1959 B.V.Makarov and V.H.Gulikov,
engineers from one of the secret enterprises joined Fomin. In
1959-50 they delivered first lectures and made reports on UFO
prob lems.
fn these years the Moscow Planetarium /in particular/ showed
their negative attitude towards the UFO problem, To the plenty of
letters that were addressed to the Planetarium about UFO
F. Y. Zegel devoted about 10 manuscripts to

o

observations, answers wete printed on standard forms which read

Academician L.A.Arzimovich's opinion and ensured our hopeless lag

This article iniLiated persecutions and malisious attacks

But UFOs and aliens didn't obey the orders and instructions,
and the problem continued to exist in the USSR.
0n ApriI L3 1967 Academician Konstantinov addresses Civilian
Aviation Minister E.F.Loginov with a request to give him data
about civilian pilots'observations of UFO for his book "Inhabited Cosmos. In September 1967 such materials were presented to
him /Ietter n 2513-36,September 5,1967, which was sent by Vicellinister L. Zholudev to Academician Konstantinov/.
0n May 17, 1967 the meeting of the initiative group of UFO
I'
"
place in the Central House of Aviation and
investigators
took
i
Space Researches /there were t5 persons at the meeting/.
Major-GeneraI P. A, Stolyarov was elected a leader of this group,
and the Assistant-Professor F. Y. Zegel as his deputy.
In October L967 it was determined to found the Department of
UFO in the AII-Union Committee of Space Researches of DOSAAF in
accordance with the decision of the director of the Central House
of Aviation, Major*General L, D, Reino.
0n October 18, 1967 the first meeting of this Department took
place in the Central House of Aviation, about 350 persons were
present at it, including the reptesentatives of Radio, TV and the
ptess, The Department consisted of 208 persons. The Bureau was
elected with I'lajor-General at it's head, the department was
divided into sections, the preliminary plan of the work of the
Department was Iaid down.
At the end of November, 1967, the DOSAAF Central Commettee
under the head of Army General A.L.Getman adopted a conclusion to
disband the UFO Department. It was a second blow against the
problem of the State level. And at the end of 1967 it was a
third blow. 0n the initiative of Academicion L. A. Arz imovich the
headed by him Department of General and Applied Physics of the
Academy of Sciences passed a resolution denouncing UFO researches
in the USSR /"Ptavda", Febtuary 29, 1958 - "Flying saucers
aga i n" /.
0n February 15, 1958 it was a cteative discussion about UFO
problems in the Central House of Jornalists.
On February 16, 1968 thirteen leading designers and engineets
- membets of the Innitiative Group addressed a letter to the
Chairman of the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR A.N.Kosigin, in
which they proved the scientific and strategic importance of the
UFO prr:blems, teasoned into the reality and global character r:f
UF0s. But the ]ate Kosigin of course learnt nothing about the
letter addressed to him as about many other letters.
The answer was received on March 11 1968 signed by
Academician A.Shukin. Every sentence in this letter was a lie.
The aollection "Inhabited Cosmos"had been preparing 10 years for
I
the publication. 32 "seditious" articles of the nrost outstanding
Soviet and foregn scientists were removed, and only 37 "steriIe"

At the end of I97q the rrPtogram of the investigations of
communications with out-of-earth civiIizations" was prepared by
the Scientific Soviet of Radioastronomy of the Academy of
Sciences and published in the Astronomical Magazine, volume 51, 5
197q, p.1125-1132. It is a point in this document: "Special
attention should be paid to the possibility of finding of the
probes of out-of-earth civilizations in our solar system and even
on the orbit around the Earth.For seeking of these quickly transferring objecLs the system of constant conttol of the whole sky
must be supplemented with special radio direction finding. 0n the
first stage it is possible to use the existed cornplexes of space
communications and radio direction f inding".
However, with the rise of the number of UFO observations the
number of articles defaming the UFO problem also tose, but not in
"Pravdail this time, but in other editions, and serious, truthful
articles were a rare phenomenon.
0n 0ctober 29, 1976 al the meeting of the Rector department
of MAI it was adopted a decission to organize a
Scientific-Technical Soviet of UFO problems and candidate-members
to this Soviet were named. But on November eg 1976 "Komsomolskaya
Pravda" published an article under the headline: "The technology
of a myth /about flyinq saucers, aliens and other mirracles/'r.
The author of this material was Eremei Iudovich Parnov.
In Decembet, 1976 Assistant-Professor R, G. Varlaamov, a woTker
of the State Committee on Science and Technique of the Soviet of
Ministers of the USSR addressed to A. N. Kosigin with a suggestion
to organize scientific study of UFO in the USSR. The lettet was
forwarded to the Expert Commission of the Department of General
Physics and Agtronomy of the Academy of Sciences. The answer
received by Vailaamov is worth to be cited, as it is a typical
example of the attitude of official scientists to alI new.: "Your
rnaterials have been sent to the Department of General Physics and
astronomy of the Acadenny of Sciences of the USSR for an attentive
study. [Je inform you, that already in 1961 the Buteau of the
Department noted the following:
The articles about the so-called "flying saucers" have been
published in the Soviet press lately, it was implicated in these
articles various lighting objects, which are presented as unknown
to the science things or space-crafts launched from othep worlds.
These fantasies have no scientific ground, and observed phenomena
have well-known nature. In connection to this question the Bureau
of the Department of General Physics and astronomy has resolved:
1. To strengthen the explanatory work in connection with this
propaganda of "flying saucersrr.
2,. To condemn this unhealthy sensations bearing the features
of charlatanism and leading wide public circles astray.
3. to appeal to all members of the Department and Institute
to fight

There were articles about this phenomenon in other newspapeTs
also, in particular in "Izvestiya". Then other reports about
strange phenomena at that night were forthcoming from other parts
of the Soviet Union and from abroad, F, Y. Zegel wtote in those
days: "Strange phenornena in the sky on September ZO 1977 were
observed on a large territory from Helsinki to Petrozavodsk and
from Pscov to Mutmansk. . . abnomal phenomena were observed from 3

The activity of this section continued a bit longer than a

the Bureau /including the chairman of the Bureau/ was invited to
special bodies and had 'reducational talks" there. They were
suggested to stop their work in the Bureau, sorne special
directions wele sent to the offices were the members of the
Bureau worked. And at last on August 5 198tt the newspaper
"Socialist Industry" opened a new era in UFO problem study in the
USSR. The article "Mysteries of heavenly phenornenar? started with
the words:"The Committee of VSENTO dealing with the problems of
environmental protection has organized a Commission on abnomal
phenomena. The organization of this Commission is caused by the
desire to attract wide public and scientific circules to the
investigations of phenomena and effects observed in nature, which
haven't had scientific explanations yet, including the so-called
UFO,

interesting "tandem" was coming to meet them. IJhen the head pilot
of the Leningrad "TU' Gozeridze saw the "tandem't he made up his
ming to fly as near to it as he could to have a good look at this

directed at the air-craft from the UFO which wounded Gozeridze
heavily and also hurted second pilot Kabachnikov. Gozeridze was
taken to hospital and died there from an illness similar to

Radars keep an eye on UF0s.

Supplement 1.

The information about UFOs which were registered by
radiolocators 8nd confirmed by visual or with the help of optical
devices are of especial significance.
Professor Obert writes: t'Due to Tadars'data, values of speed
of some UFO are about 11.8 miles per second or about 70000 km per
hour /it's higher than the second circular velocity-L.Ch./ There
are about 1000 cases of radars'obsetvations of UFOs".
In the period from l9t8 to 1962 the National Committee of
aerophenomena investigations collected data of 81 cases of
radars'fixation of UFOs, 50 of them were confirmed by visual
observations, and so can't be assigned as radars' technical

defects.

In this connection it's hard to overestimate the irnportance
of the well-known case of the UFO detection by an reconnaissance
aircraft B-tl7 of the American Air-Defence Forces, which was
equipped with the newest electronic measuring instruments for
that time. Above the Mexican Gulf early in the morning of June
17, L957, the crew managed to radiolocate UFO, which for a long
time was playing 'rcat-and-mouse" with the aircraft, and to
measure the frequency of it's radiation, It was 28000 MGz.
There are cases when UFOs are observed visually and not
radared; and vise versa.

t', . . the radio operator at the control tower. . . received a
strange report. It was reserved the tape of their recorded

convetsat ion:

"Commander /Lieutenant Charles Taylor/. The earth, . . lle are on

The Commander of the leading air-craft reported:
"The both compasses ate out of or.del".
"Durinq alI this time a very powerful radio-station of the
Naval Base was unable to set a contact with the air-crafts,
though the conversations between them were heard rather well".
The last wnrds received from "Flight-19" were: "lJe aTe wrapping
in a white water... IJe have lost orienting at aIL "
By the wayf' Colomb wrote about the white water of the Bagams
in his ship's diary,
According to other data the last radio-gram fronr "Flight*19"
was: "Don't fly after me. . . They seem tn be from the Cosmos. "
"AbouL 7p.*, radio-station of the Naval Base not far from

attempt of the lost to let the Base know about them? In this case
they sent their radiogram two hours after their fuel had come to

an end.
0n the next day the greatest operation in the history of
search operations started. 210 ships of the US NF, 67 air-crafts
from the air-craft carrier "Salomon", four torpedo-boat
destroyers, many subrnarines, 18 ships of the shore guard
search boats, hundreds of private air-planes, yachts, divisions
of the British Navy and Aviation of the Bagama Islands,But the
seatches were failures...It is interesting to mention that
neither "Fl ight-19t' nor the hydroplane sent a'rSOSrr signal.
The version of a forced alighting fell away."Avengets"were able
to remain on the surface of the sea during 90 seconds. The
menrbers of the crew had special training to leave the air-craft
during 60 seconds".

fi le case
OnIy one case has been described here not fully. It was only
one though the most sensational case of hundreds of cases of airplanes disappearance in the Bermuda TriangIe.
AdoIf Shneider in his book 'rVisitors from the Universe"
enumerated a number of cases of air-planes'disappearance above
the Bermuda Triang1e. There were cases which nonplused aIl
persons dealing with the "ttianglet' phenomenon and put in an
embatrassing p6sition all those who tried to refute "rnirracles'r.
Here is a number of Lraceless disappearance of air-planes,
which can't be rejected: "Tudot-t" in 19118, the American
transport air-craft in 1919,the EngIish "Armel" 1950, and "Yotk"
1953, the American "Super Constallation" in 195t, the bomber of
the NF in 1955, "KV-50" 1962 and two "KS-135" in 1961. A lot of
books are devoted to the Bermuda Triangle abroad. To our
mind, Charles BerI izns book "The Bermuda Triangle"and t'The Mystery

The examination of the air*craft showed a lot of damages of

these damages was so unusual, that no Teasonable explanations
were found.
The following event took place in summet of 1955, in England
in the Suffolk counLy, Here is only the final of the event
presented.
About midnight the air-craft of the "Venom'r type started from
the Base of the Enqtish ADF, the air-craft was equipped with
radiolocation installation. The pilot reported, that he saw a
bright white fire and tried to follow the object' Having flied
about 10 miles the pilot informed that he had lost the objective
in the radar screen and visually. Then the statinn directed him
to another objective, hanging in the air at 10 miles from
Lekenhit. The pilot reported, that he saw the objective in the
screen. After several seconds he lost it, because of the quick
manoeuvre of the UF0, which came to the air-craft's tail at a
moment. The pilot didn't even notices the manoeuvre, but it was
observed in the radar screens on the earth. All his attempts to
break away were failures.This "hunting for a huntet"Iasted for 10
rninutes, until the frightened pilot began to make a landing. It
is interesting to mark, the object made his wonderful manoeuvre
at the moment when the pilof had already caught the objective and
was going to shoot.
The similar event took place in September of 1957 above the
ADF Base in Albukern, in New-Mexico.

Paris, September 21,

The France Press Agancy Comespondent passes ftom Tegeran:
The Iranian government confirmed yesterday in the evening,
that two jet planes "Fantom" of the Iranian ADF pursued a ?'flying
saucer' above the capital on Saturday.
Two pilots informed in their turn that

a mysterious object
Interceptors lifted up in the air in the civilian air-port in
Mehrabad, after controllers had found out a round object
radiating red, blew, gTeen Iight. The Tegeran newspapers
presented the pilots' words, saying that when they overtook the
i'saucer" at the height of 1800 metres, it left them far back
having developed a speed several times more than the speed of
sound only in order to return and follow them.
IJhen Lhe pi lots tried to disable it, their electronical
and radiocommunicative systems were out of order as suddenly
were'tparalysed", According to their description this "saucer"

pursued them.

Due to the report, a round object 15 foots in size soon
devided from it's "aviabase'r and landed to the south of Tegeran.
This territory was combed by helicopters, but the results of the
raid were not announced.
0n the night of October 1, 19{8, Lieutenant Gorman had an air
fiqht with a diminutive UFO above Fargo ./the Northen Dakota,/which
lasted for 27 minules. After a usual patrol flight Gormen's

Then Gorman directed his fighter at the object. He reported
the following: "The object is absolutely white and tound, 6 or I

Then Gorman directed his fighter at the object. He reported
the following: 'rThe object is absolutely white and round, 5 or B
inches in diameter and has something like a fluffy edging. It
flashes out at one moment and goes out at another, ilhen I came
near to it, it suddenly lit wiLh even bright Iight and swang to

we flied directly against each other.,. I went into a power dive
and it flied over me at 500 f. Then it lifted up in a spiral at
1000 f. height and I again began to follow it'r.
The manoeuvres of this object made Gorman sure that the
object was controlled by mind. An eye-witness, observing this
Gorman's fight from the earth informed that he saw a light coming
from a quickly moving object. The similar air fight took place on
December tl, 1952 above the Aviabase Laredo. Lieutenant FogI on
his fighter F-51 attacked a quick disc-shaped object, in tesponse
to which the object attacked the fiqhter. As a result the pi lot
was taken intoohospital in a hard shock.
0n January 7 , 19tB at the AF Base Godman, not far from Fort*
Nox /Kentucky/ an object was noticed in the sky, it was like an
ice-cteam ball with a red top. The information about this object
was confirmed by a lot of eye-witnesses, among them there vtere
both military and civilian persons. The officer on duty ordered
to Iift up air-crafts I'F-51?'
And here are extracts from the report of the ADF:
"Three air-crafts, came up to the obgect and reported that, it
was metallic and of a huge size.,, The Commander of the section,
Captain Thomas F, Mantel communicated with the Control Tower and
reported, thaf the object was situated just above them. "f am
approaching it to have a good look of it, - Mantel broadcasted- It
is just in front of me and is flying twice as slow than we. . . This
thinq is meLallic and of a huge size, Now it is gaining height
and flies with the same speed as I. . . I'Il gain 20000 f, height

stop following it". .
At this the communication with Mantel was interupted/l / And

a testing aerodrome in Kapustin Yar.
0n June 15 19118 he tifted the machine up in the air. At the
height of 10500 metres he was above the compact cover of clouds.
HalF an hour after he had come to the coulse, he saw an unusual
flying apparatus going the cross coulse to Iifting down.The

Apraksin having communications with the Base constantly reported
about what he had seen and got an answeT, that the apparatus was
fixed by radars, he was ordered to lift down but obeyed. Then the
base gave an order to approach the apparatus and if it continued
to refuse to land, Apraksin would disable it.
According to this order Apraksin directed his craft. to the
t
apparatus. lJhen there were ohly about 10 km. between them, the
blims from the apparatus "opened as a fan", and lit up the craft,for a second Aiiaksin was-dazzled. At the sarne moment he found

that of Apraksin in all details. After three months Apraks.in was
taken back to his previous aerodrome, In spring of 1919 tltpy

travel inside their galaxy. They learnt
that in the centre of their starry world a "irusher" was. That
the way of all stars through a long vortex of time leaded there.
It was the end of everything. More over they learnt that the
neighbouring galaxy was approaching to them inevitably, that the
terrible cataslrophe was to be soon...A question rose:"How will
everything be 6aved? IJhere are safe places in the Universe? Is it
possible to evacuate the whole worlds and how?. . And at last how
to save the individual 'rf 'r of each intellectual creature.
It could be proceeded successfully by concenttating,
comptession, lessening of volume and weight, but main... transferring in another condition. Every living thing could be
saved if to create genetical funds, and what was to be done with
individual 'rl'r? By destroying the whole a living thing made of
Iight was created. Environment could influence it no longer. It
obtained the ability to compress, to grow according lo the set
rhythm, It had memory, mind, sight, hearing... It couldn't only to
propagate itself. But in this case durable interstar flights were
possible. It was possible to find safe places in the Universe and
start a life, to grow plants and rear animals under the command
of those light thinking creatures, "imprints" of individual rrltrs.
I conf irm nr:thing in this question, but I have realized that
a man is a very complicated living thing, a symbiosis. I warn
that I don't try to analyse dualism and monism. I only present
what I have heard and seen as an objective reality, Besides that
they talked about one ancient working convention.
- so a man continues to rernernber aII his life even when he is
bur ied;
- only his cover is buried and essence is alive;
- May I have any evidences?
- Now you will hear the dead and will learn their feelings
Futher Kostrikin gave a description of his being in "The kingdom of the dead similar to the descriptions of their after
death experience people having been reanimated /R.l{oudy's book
"Life after death"/ Malishev also saw a man from the next world
who was his neighbour and died from alcohol abuse when he was on
"without suntr planet. Malishev didn't come up to the rnan, as it
was terrible t$ough the nran was smiling,
From his "contact" Kostrikin in particular found out the
phylosophical meaning of a life "A man, as it was explained to
fi¤, is free in his actions to a celtain extend, neither a mudetet
nor his victim will disappear, everyone will get according to his
deeds. That there is one truth for all, for aLheists and
believers, for people of various nationalities. This truth is:to
be good or evi l for a society. "
And further: ?rThe real life of an individual is sornehow
def ined but his previous Iife and direct his future livesr'.
In it's essence it is a laconic and clear interpretation of a
conception of "karma" - a foundation-stone of oriental
phylosophies. And only
ignorant people, who can't think
independently, whose brains are fuII with dogmas, call these
thruthes as idealism, mysticism and superstition. It doesn't come
to their heads that "matter" is much richer reality as they can
imagine. They believe without reserve in what they have been
tammed orally and in written from. The authority of visitors of
alien planets is nothing in comparison with these dogrnas. That is
the reason they never contact with visitors. Kostrikin left them
for thousand years behind in his attitude, when declaringr "I have
neveT been an admirer of mysticism and superstition. The both
these qtords have been invented by people. Everything is natural

his contact? It
exists. You only must read his book-report attentively. His
\ predictions about time and place of UFO appearance have come
i ttue, his interesting "discoveries", which the official science
doesn't want to know, are worth to be analysed, his detailed
descriptions of space-crafts - crystals are also very
interesting. Fnr people with developed intuition the most evident
is the story itself,
it's organic logic, psychological
saturation, it couldn't be invented, even if he be a Solomon. It
could be written only by a witness of these events.
Belesin Valentin Ivanovich also had a contact. He is of the
same age with Kostrikin Viktor Petrovich. Both of them wrote very
detailed reports, both conducted very interesting scientific
experiments /in particular, they suggested non-traditional
mercurial energy generators/
X our scientists knowing nothing about works of Kostrikin and
Belesin have worked out control specimens of spinor fields
qenerat"ors using the analogous pTinciple,
Both Kostrikin and Belesin tried to take out patents for
their discoveries and inventions, which in the opinion of the
representatives of the official science were impossible, but they
not only exist, but function disaproving our scientific
paradigms, Both Kostrikin and Belesin have changed their notions
about the world, and accordingly have made reappraisal of values,
inspite of the fact that they differ very much.
Once Belesin was asked a question, if he knew the name
Kostrikin. He thought for a moment and answeTed: "No, I have never
heard". My question was conditioned by the fact,that they lived
relatively near: Kostrikin - in Nalchik, Belesin - in Krasnodar,
IJhen I was sure that they had never seen each other, I suggested
Belesin to read Kostrikin's book "Behind the edge of mysteryil
Belesin read the book for about ten minutes until ran across the
place where "the nexL world" was described, shut the book and
said: "Hhat a rich fantasy this man has! ".

In September of 1966 the instruction AFR 200-2 was
substituted fot a new instruction AFR 80-17, which ordered aII
the commanders of aviabases to establish observation posts and
investigate all cases of UFO flights, for ascettaining what it
was in reality. At the sarne time directions of presenting reports
about UFOs observed wete given and detailed instructions for
pilots behqviour at meetings with UFOs were presented. It was
pointed out that ADF personnel wete to assure the safety of the
obtained pieces belonging or supposed to belong to UFOs and not
to cause indif,astions, which would lessen their value for
analysis /VasiIiev "UF0-evolution of American views and
concepts", a manuscript, L98O/,
In the directions of the Commandor of the NF Stuff in the US
OPNAV 9{-HP-3B the instructions about the system of alarnrs on the
American continent were presented and it was also ordered to
report to commandors about the appearance of unknown rockets,
UFOs, ships, submatines and air-crafts, In the supplement to the
directives the pictures of disc-shaped and oblong UFO wele
featured /Burre "UFO: the Army talks",1979/ Besides that for
accelerating of UFO identifications the most of American warships
had the pictures of the main UFO types /Adolf Shneider "Visitors
from the Universet', 1976/,
In the reference book of the American AD the pictures of UFO
in the form of a disc with lights was featured /Geigentaler "UFOs
out-of-earth space-crafts, 1976 / .
It must be also mentioned that in the textbook of the AF
Academy of
the US "fndroduction in the science of
cosmosrt,published in 1968 and destined for the students of the
Academy, UFOs weTe described in details in lt pages and it was
marked definetely: "The most clear theoty consists in the
following: UFOs ale nraterial objects with crews or remote control
and which are considered to be out-of-earth, It is the best to be
attentive, vigilant when weeting them and not to take extrerne
measurestt. Then in the textbook it was analysed the possible
Teasons, why contacts between people and UFOs had not be
established and the examples of the attemts to intercept and
disable UFO were given, In the conclusion it was pointed out that
scientific researches of UFO Tan across rnankind's limited
knowledge of

physics and that

our rnodetn knowledge was

inapplicable for understanding UFO's features/Adolf Shneider

UFO

American sfiecial
"UF0-logy"/1975,volume 2, N 3, p.3t/wrote 'rCandidate-President of
the US Jimmy Carter spoke ardently in support of the idea of UFO
reality he considered himself among those 5000000 Americans

Tomaston, in Georgia, he observed UFO together with other twenty

But it happened nothing of the kind as what Carter wanted to
do as a candidate, he already couldn't rnake and had no right to
make as a President. And meanwhile in the period when Carter was
a President in February 1978 NASA considered UFO to be a subject
of the special attention of the Soviet of National Security - the
highest body coordinating and controling the functioning of alI
governmental bodies in military politics, the constant members of

NASA meeting the demands of Pentagon and the CIS undertook
some measuTes aiming at consealinq all data of UFO observations in

the space and on the Moon. As it has been already mentioned it
was presented some data about the facts, that during the
fulf i lment of the program 'rAppolon" f inished in 1972, in the
Goddara Space Centre it existed an instruction to "clean the
pictures and telemetrical data coming from the Moon, referring to
UFO. " /Adolf Shneider "Visiters from the Universe", 1976/
Measures to prevent the invesLigations of UFO observations
obtained by American austtonauts were taken by Pentagon in the
following years. So in the letter of the Commandor of the
Communicative Department of the AF Ministry, Colonel Senn sent in
L977 to the worker of NASA, Lieutenant-General Crow it was
pointed out, that standard answers to the public inquiries about
observations of UFO in space had been worked out by AF and a hope
was expressed that it would be possible to prevenL the resumption

of UFO reseatches by civilian scientists.
It is also known that American leadership always opposed the
creation of any internalional organizations dealing with UFO
study. It is conf irmed by the reaction of the Arnerican Governrnent
to the Grenada pToposal to discuss the question about organizing
a special department in the UNO for coordination of UFO
teseatches nrade at the UNO session in 1977. The State Department
then immidiately gave instructions to the UNO representative
Young to declare, that "the USA will not take part in the
adclption of the resolution caIIing to found any organization
dealing with the invastigation of the possibility of contacts
with mental Iife within or outside the Solar system. "/The second
memorandum of ICUF0N l98O/. AS a resull of this US position the
Grenada proposal was blocaded. And at the repeated discussion of
the proposal in 1978 it came to the appeal to all countries Lo
inform about their observations and investiqations of UFO the UNO
Committee of peaceful use of space.
The American authorities make short work of those officials
who against all instructions start to research UFO phenomena oT
Lry to lay bare the mysteries "undeT seven seals". So in 1952 the
Air Force Command refused to give any explanations to the US NF
Minister Kimball about two disc-shaped UFOs observed personally
by him during his flight above the Hawaiian Islands, and when
Kimball tried to start the investigations by the naval
reconnaissance forces, the CIS pressed for his dismissal
,/Shurinov B. A. ItThe paradox of the XX th centure", manuscript
1980/.
And here is the latest example, proving that a modern
American administration and the Soviet of National Security
continues to pay serious attention to the UFO problem. In January
of 1981 the Director of ICUFON Fon Kevizky sent to President
Reigan two memgranda, in which he expressed his preoccupations in
connection with the supposedly existed threat to our civilization
from UFO. These memoranda included 20 former secret government
documents and materials about the actions of military forces of
different countries against UFO.
0n November 21 1981 Fon Kevizky received an answer on behalf
of the Soviet of National Security /on it's form/ written by the
Main Military
President Councillor, Hajor-General Robert
L. Shweitser, which read:
"The President is well aware of the danger, which have been
so obviously documented by you, and he is making his best as soon
as possible and at the same time very carefully to find the
possibilities to ensure security in the sphere of the National
defence",/the third mernorandum of ICUFON, L98?/. Very soon the
President Counci llor, Major-General Robert L. Shweitser was
dismissed frorn his high post without explanations,

the CIS agreed to promulgate only the part of the existed
documents and refused to discover the content of the others. Then
the organization brought an action against the CIS. It demanded
of the CIS to give 57 things founded at the places where UFOs had
crashed. But at a Court Session in July 1978 the General US
ProcuratoT was present and took the CIS under his protection and
accepted an action for a few number of documents, siying that the
sign of secrecy was stamped to them later and so they couldn,t be

The situation when people-UF0 observers were wocked at,
intimidated and even taken into lunatic houses las it was with

Aplaksin/ resulted in our loss of the great amount of
information. Military men /not only soldiers, but also officers
of high ranks/began to hush up the cases of the UFO appearances
and contacts maybe. And civilian pilots and other workers have
followed their example. It is a not grounless supposition, that
cosmonauts in 1979 /after Romanenko and Grechko,s observations of

UFos in the orb it./ were forb idden to g ive such informat ion

The group of UFOIoqists from Obninsk went to "Kerzhach" to
clear up the mysterious circumstances of Gagarin and
Seregin,s
death at their UTI MIG-15. Some independent eye-witnesses of this
catastrophe were found. All of them said that the air-craft
followed a luminescence object of a large size, which caused the
catastrophe. The materials of this catastrophe examinaLions are

"In summer 1951 a huge cigar 800 m. long appeared above

Voronezh at the height of 2000 m. and hung without moving. It
happened in the daytime and thousands of people saw it.,.
Suddenly the cigar became transparent and disappeared. Soon

Data about UFO intrusion in the Asian part of the Soviet
Union were published in Dick Lester's article in the American
magazine 'tSaga". It was presented in it that Japanese wireless

enthusiast Kaen Ku seemed to have heard the following
conversation broadcasted by a MIG pilot:
- Below.,. a flying disc - reported the pilot in a low voice
- it is a large round object with oblong hatches lighting with

b lue.

llhen the UFO approached to his air-craft the pi lot ln
accotdance with the order obtained fired
rocket volleys and
reported about it, and then added:
- Nothing! The rockets have exploded at 600 m. from the

object, .

.

Then it was heard a crash and the pilot's agitated voice:
- It has turned to the right...It is coming into collision...
I have no time for.., These were the last woids that Kaen Ku
managed to hear,

In this accident that took place to the north of Vladivostok

above the Sihote-Alin mountains, Dick Lester saw the confirmation
of such other actions from UFO, as a Tesult of which more than 15
pilots of the US AF and NF fell victims.
0n ApriI 27 1970 a faster-than-sound bomber making a flight
from Moscow to Vladivistok disappeared without leaving a trice
above the Siberia. It's pilot was having radio communication with
a ground station and suddenly the communication was broken off.
During the intensive raid more than 200 air-crafts searched
thoroughly the territory above which the bomber was situated when
the communication was broken off. t'lJe are not alone here, not less
than 25 space-crafts are above us, " pi lots, participants of the
search, reported, -"but they are very high and we can't approach

the plane an even circle 30 metres in diameter with burnt glass

At this we finish our not complete review of intrusions "ftom
without" in the air space above out country, though intrusions
themselves ale not finished.
0n July 1, 195tt in the radar scleen in the Aviabase in
Griffit /New-York/ a strange objective was found and a fighter
"Statfire F-91" was lifted up to intercept it. Two minutes later
a pilot reported that he saw a glittering disc-shaped object
hanging in the air motionless and flied up to it. Suddenly the
engine of the fighter came out of order. The pilot saw
instruments stop functioning and felt a current of hot air on his
face. The pilot ordered his radio operator to catapult and then
followed him. Leaving his fighter the pilot saw the UFO once
more. The both pilots landed successfully, and their machine
damaged some living houses, some people fell victims to this
catastrophe.
Captain Jin de Beisak was the first pilot of a cargo craft C15, which took off Port-Alegre in San-Paulo at night of November
3, 1957 /the day of the most numbet of UFO observations in the US
/. The air-craft was rlflying at a height of 77OO feet, At about
1.30 a.m, om November the pilot saw a strange red light a bit
lower and to the left of the air-craft. He said to another pilot
to incline and have a look of a "real flying saucerrr. The latter
had a look and they laughed at this joke, But soon they were
past laughter. After a few minutes when Beisak had a look
downwards and to the left, he saw the same red object quickly
approaching them. The pilot tried to swing, but the object's
speed was higher than that of the air-craft, it lifted up
quickly. Before Beisak managed to end his manoeuvre, the UFO had
flied very near to the craft. The pilots had the feeling of
something burning very near, but indicators didn't register it.
The examination showed that a radiotransmitter, generator had
been burnt out. Captain Beisak turned his machine around and
reached Port-Alegre with great difficulty.
0wing to complete and effective investigations of the Air
Phenomena Research Organization /APRO/which presented an article
in it's bulletin in l'lay of 1"959, the details of the accident with
a military air-craft became aware.
The first of Apri I of the 1959, 7. tt a, m. - this moment was a
start point of the tragedy - an extreme radio call ftom an
air-craft C-118 with four members crew on it's board, which had
taken off
from the ADF Base llak-Chordfield, Takorna,
IJashington: "lJe have struck against something oT something have
struck against us". Then a few seconds of silence after which the
pilot cried: "Help! HeIp! I' and then: "Here it is! Here it is! ". The
large air-craft fell to pieces betweem Samper and Orting. Nobody
remained alive. Military athorities cordoned the territory off
quickly to save it from civilians and reporters. Eye-witnesses of
the catastrophe saw two olange objects following "C-118rr very
closeIy.
ADF Major Mervin Stenvers flied on the night of June 22,
1956, on the air-craft ?'KONVER" /C-L3LD/ The f light was conducted
at a heiqht of 15000 feet nol far from Piksli, California. Later
the pilot said that suddenly the air-craft began to tremble and
struck against something with it's right board. Before Major
Stenvers rnanaged to do something, "KONVER" had gone into a power
dive. OnIy at a height of 9000 feet the pilot managed to align the
machine. Major Stenvers radioed, that his craft had been struck
by "a flying saucer'r and asked for permission to make a ctash
landing in the airport Bakersfield, Jornalists made photoes of

fact that they had managed to land.
0n Apri I 18, 196e, a shining red object crossed the United
States from New-York to Utah and was registered by radars all
it's way along. It landed near an electric power station and put
it out of action. After tt8 minutes it exploded in the air
followed by air-crafts - interceptors,
In August, 1955 thousands of people observed air-crafts interceptors following 7 UFOs in Daluta ,/Minnesota/. A radar base
registered both air-crafts and UF0s,
In Januaty, 1965, the third massive UFO flight upon
ilashington took place, 0n January 11 at about { p,m. The 20th
group of signallers which were in the military str:re in street 19
rushed to windows to watch an interesting "perfolmancer'. The
signallers had been given notice about it by their comrades from
a radar department, IZ, persons observed a group of 15 white
egg-shaped objects flying at a height of 12-15000 feet. They were
followed by two fighters, but UF0s outstripted their persuers
easi ly. It was "The Start? one of the first newspapers to inform
about the fact enumetating the eye-witnesses' names.
0n 0ctober 22, 1978 twenty-year Australian pilot Frederic
ltelentich disappeared without leiving any trace together with his
craft during his flight above the Straits of Bassov separating
Australia from Tasmania. Before the communication with him was
broken off, he had radioed that he was followed by an UFO and
asked whether this UFO was registered by radars. He got an answer
that no other air-crafts were in this region. The object was not
registered by radars.
One of the most interesting cases, being to fhe point, was
described in A.Sheider's book "Visitors from the Universe",1976.
IJe are prepenting this case here with some shortening,
0n January 12, 1972, in the evening, Mrs. Parker from Oklahoma

had a telephone conversation with her daughter, which was suddnly
interrupted and the both women heard somebody's voice:
- Here is the Central Post Norad /the command of the US
ADF/...It is a battle alarm "red..,l'toscow is informed,..lJe have a
problem.,,Accept Tinker /the name of an aviabase/.,.lJe are trying
to call Tinker by the second channel,.,
Then Mrs. Parker put the leceivet, and after some time again
called her daughter who had heard that two fighters were sent to
intercept an UFO flying to Houston, Alamogordo, Los-Angeles.
Then the voice continued: "Ue tegister objects appearing from
the Pacific Ocean and the Mexican GuIf...Fiqhters ate on their
way.. . It is not training alarm. . . It is a battle alarm. .. "
After Lhat Mrs.Parker's daughter heard: "0ne object has fallen
into the Pacific Ocean, and the fighters have been disabled! "
Sherry's/it's the name of the daughter./ husband said that he
heard, that two fighters "F-101 were disabled above the
Alamogordo Desert, and two UF0s were Iifting down or diving. At
the end clf the conversation the voice said: "The fighters are
observing the objects, invite the President to the telephone...'r
Then a voice at the other end: "Ptesident is hearing... "* and the

voice very Iike the voice r:f President Nickson. -"It was the most
unusual conversation I have ever heard,.. "
Then Sherry' husband communicated with the CTS of Oklahoma
and asked, whether it could be that they had been connected with
the state I ine, he got an answel, that it seemed they had been
connected with NORAD.
American investigators of UFOs examined this case very
carefully and canre to the following conclusions:
1, A battle alarm took place on that day,
e, UFOs were observed above the Pacific Ocean and Mexican
Gulf.
3. Fighters were raised in the air and two of them weTe
disabled, and two UF0s fell down in the ocean.

Ll, The President's voice h'as heard.
Then it was informed that there were witnesses who saw the
pieces of the fdisabled air-crafts, and the picture of UFOs
falling in the 0cean existed.
The description of aIl cases of collisions between air-crafts
and UFOs could make a collection of many volumes of dramatic
events in the air. Our task was to give a review of some cases of

the kind, As it has been mentioned above, fighters often had
attempts to intercept UFOs after tadats' registrations.

Supplement 3.
Abnomal phenomena on the Moon.

It seems to be not a misunderstandinq that during the
fulf ilment of the program 'rAppolo" it was ordered to "clear out"
aII pictures and data obtained from the l'toon which could be
identif ied with UFOs.
Nevertheless the pictures of the Moon surface made by the
Soviet and American space apparatuses /in particular by I'Moon-grl
and "Lunat orbiter*2" fell into the hands of people who delved
intn all details and were carefully examed by them. As a result
of it, as one in a number of examples, an interesting article
"0h, this mysterious Moon'r was publ ished in the rnagaz ine "Youth
Technique'rn5in1969,
In this article State prize laureate, stereo film inventor S.
Ivanov and
engineer A. Brukhonenko attracted teaders'
attention: ". . . the distances between stones 1, 2, 3, t are equal!
Besides that, they are equal in size... Pay attention to the fact
that there is po hill near the place from which these stones
could have rolled down and "by chance'r stood in such a
way...stones frnm 5 to 11 are also situated along a straight line
parallel to the line of the first four. And stones 2, 7, 12 and
13 are situated along the Iine crossing these parallel at an
angle of 60 degrees. Stones 1, 15, 16 also fotm a line, And at
Iast one mole curious detail:stones I, ltl, 15 form a equilateral
tr i ang lerr.
Further the convetsation is continued by engineer
A, Abramov: 'r, . , what are the pclinted shadows, long and shorter are
crossing the separate part of the picture? The longest of the
shadows could be cast by only a very tall monument on the Earth.
Shorter shadows are cast by objects /B of them/ of regular conic
forms, as large as tall Christmas trees. These things are more
curious, because they are situated on a very small square 165X225
metres. Futher wonderful geometrical regularity of these objects
are enumerated, their simi larity to the plan of the Egyplian
pyramids ./"with the exactness clf the mirror ref lectionrr/ The
article is illustraLed with various picLures.
As far as mysterious Iiqht phenomena on the Moon are
concetned, they have been observed with telescopes for a long
time already. The first observation of an unusuat light dot on
the shady part on the half-moon was registered in Vorrnei in 1150.
In 1968 the National Administration on aetonautics and space
fIights /USA/ issued "Chronological Catalogue of events on the
Moon"
Here are some extracts from it:

them. They were situated in the middle of the Moon disc and were
moving with a mi I itary regularity.

April 21, 187{
Professor Shafaric from the Prague Observatory informed, that
he saw a shining object moving along the Moon disc, the object
left the Moonothen and fIied in space. Shafaric asked :"[hat
could it be as if not a flying apparatus? Planets and moons don't
throw away objects".
T9T2-

American asttonomel Garris informed, that he had seen a large
object with the diameter of 80 km flying above the Moon. The
object was seen clearly and flied so close to the Moon surface
that cast a shadow on it.

Apri I 21, I97e
The Passay 0bservatory made a photo of a rnysterious light
fountain in the Aristarkh crater. The Iight emission reached the
height of 162 km. and it's speed was 1,3 km per second. 0n
reaching the top "the fountain" fell down 50 km. aside.

It. is interesting the appearance of objects which have never
been observed on the Moon and the disappearance of elements of
the surface which wete well-known for a long time.
So in 1922 in the Archimed crater three banks appeared though

now volcanic activity was noticed.

On all lunar maps before 1886 the Linne crator near the lunar
equatot was depicted. And suddenly in 1886 it disappeared and
only a white spot rernained, And modern asttonomers have found
a cupola at this place. And on the whole there are many cupolas
with diametres ftom several metres tcl thousands of kilornetres on
the Moon.To Malishev's words ,/and he has passed all the
professional tests,/ he saw buildings very Iike hangars and other

t'f lying saucersrr on the Moon.

On July 29 1953 a straiqht bridge 20 km long was found on the
Hoon. It stretched above the Sea of Crises, and it's shadow was
distinctly seen, lJel l-known astronomet IJi lkins conf irmed the
existance clf this bridqe

In 1956 astronomer Robert Curtis filmed the surface of the

Moon and was very much surprised at seeing an un-known light
cross near the Fra Mauro crater, all the four sides of which had

an equal length of several ki lometres,

Some scientists supposed that aliens constructed their main
bases for visiting the Earth on the other side of the Moon, where
they are inaccessible for the curious eyes of earth-men. This
supposition conforms to the evidences of auctronauts having been
on the Moon and to the words of MaIishev, dn illiterate
provincial boy, as he was in 1975 on the day of his I'contact".

It is characteristic that NASA published only a small part of

250000 pictures of the I'toon.
