## ‚öôÔ∏è IDEMPOTENCY & EXECUTION TRACKING

### Execution Rules (CRITICAL - READ BEFORE PROCESSING)

1. **Package ID is unique identifier** - Format: `sherlock_chatgpt_NNN`
2. **Status determines executability:**
   - `QUEUED` = Ready for execution, pick up and start
   - `IN_PROGRESS` = Currently being executed by another agent, SKIP
   - `COMPLETED` = Finished, DO NOT re-execute
   - `FAILED` = Previous execution failed, can retry
3. **Check EXECUTION_LOG at bottom** - Never execute package already logged as completed
4. **Update status when starting** - Change to `IN_PROGRESS` + add start timestamp
5. **Log completion** - Add entry to EXECUTION_LOG when done
