# Sherlock System Development Status

**Date:** 2025-09-27 (Updated - Supervised Analysis Complete)
**System:** 2012 Mac Mini, Linux Mint Mate Xia
**Project:** Sherlock Analysis System - Voice transcription component for understanding history, current events, and humanitarian issues that have been intentionally obscured by governments worldwide. Currently focused on voice transcription capabilities with broader system expansion planned.

## Executive Summary
High-resolution voice analysis pipeline completed with 3-speaker detection capability. System recovered from overheating, all embedding analysis finished (8,805 embeddings, 541 turns). Supervised diarization script fixed and validated on 2-minute test. **SUPERVISED ANALYSIS WITH ANCHORS COMPLETED** - Full 48-minute analysis successfully executed using manually validated anchor segments.
