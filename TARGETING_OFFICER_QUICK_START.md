# Sherlock Targeting Officer - Quick Start Guide
**For Brandon - Daily Activation Commands**

---

## MORNING ACTIVATION (08:00-09:00 recommended)

### Step 1: Activate Targeting Officer (Heavy Reasoning)

```bash
cd /home/johnny5/Sherlock

claude "Activate Sherlock Targeting Officer: Review all intelligence targets, analyze current evidence focusing on UAP phenomena, anti-gravity propulsion (Biefeld-Brown, zero-point energy, T.T. Brown, Naval Radar Lab), telepathy/psi-UAP interface, and control structures. Identify gaps and design 10 research packages: 5 for ChatGPT-5 (print sources), 5 for NightShift (audio/podcast). Use heavy reasoning."
```

**What Claude will do:**
- Review all Sherlock targets and evidence
- Analyze POSS-I/1953 inflection point context
- Identify knowledge gaps systematically
- Design 10 research packages with objectives, sources, deliverables

**Wait for:** Claude to present the research packages for your review

---

### Step 2: Distribute Packages (Token Efficient)

```bash
claude "Switch to token-efficient mode. Push research packages to CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md and NightShift queue."
```

**What Claude will do:**
- Append ChatGPT packages to CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md
- Queue NightShift packages for autonomous execution
- Provide confirmation summary

---

### Step 3: Sync to GitHub (For ChatGPT-5 Pickup)

```bash
git add CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md
git commit -m "Add research packages - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push origin main
```

**ChatGPT-5 will automatically:**
- Fetch raw file from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrandonH5678/Sherlock/main/CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md`
- Check for packages with status=QUEUED
- Execute research and log completion
- Notify you when complete

**Optional Fallbacks (for reliability):**
- GitHub Pages: Enable Pages and copy queue file to `/docs/`
- Gist Mirror: Create public gist as secondary backup

---

## EVENING INTEGRATION (After research complete)

### Step 4: Collect ChatGPT Research

```bash
# Copy completed ChatGPT research to Sherlock
cp -r ~/Downloads/chatgpt_package_* /home/johnny5/Sherlock/chatgpt_research_output/
```

---

### Step 5: Integrate All Collected Intelligence

```bash
cd /home/johnny5/Sherlock

claude "Execute Claude Queue integration: Process all collected intelligence from chatgpt_research_output/ and nightshift_processing/. Perform cross-reference analysis with focus on: 1) UAP phenomena patterns, 2) propulsion technology connections (Brown-Biefeld → Naval Radar Lab → modern UAP), 3) psi-UAP interface evidence, 4) control structure mechanisms. Update evidence database and generate intelligence summary."
```

**What Claude will do:**
- Read all new research from chatgpt_research_output/
- Read all NightShift transcriptions from nightshift_processing/
- Extract claims, evidence, network connections
- Perform cross-reference analysis
- Update evidence database
- Generate intelligence summary report

---

## EVEN FASTER (One-Line Daily Trigger)

If you trust the system and want minimal interaction:

```bash
cd /home/johnny5/Sherlock && \
claude "Sherlock Targeting Officer daily cycle: analyze all targets, design 10 packages (5 ChatGPT print sources, 5 NightShift audio), push to queues, then integrate any completed research from chatgpt_research_output/ and nightshift_processing/. Heavy reasoning for analysis, token-efficient for execution. Focus: UAP, propulsion (T.T. Brown/Biefeld-Brown/ZPE), psi-UAP, control structures. Generate intelligence summary."
```

---

## PRIORITY RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS

When Claude asks "any specific focus today?", use these:

**Week 1: Foundation Gaps**
- Thomas Townsend Brown complete biography
- 1953 inflection point - all classified programs initiated
- Naval Research Laboratory 1930s context

**Week 2: Control Structures**
- Operation Mockingbird → modern media control
- Federal Reserve + BlackRock financial control
- In-Q-Tel → CIA-Silicon Valley fusion

**Week 3: Phenomenon & Technology**
- Zero-point energy / advanced propulsion research
- UAP nuclear weapons monitoring global patterns
- Stargate Project & psi-UAP interface

**Week 4: Integration & Analysis**
- Cross-reference all new intelligence
- Network mapping updates
- Strategic assessment synthesis

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK FIXES

**Claude won't activate Targeting Officer:**
- Verify you're in /home/johnny5/Sherlock directory: `pwd`
- Check database exists: `ls -la sherlock.db evidence_database.db`

**GitHub sync fails:**
- Initialize repo if needed: `git init && git remote add origin <your-repo-url>`
- Check credentials: `git config --list`

**No ChatGPT results:**
- Verify GitHub repo is accessible to ChatGPT
- Check package status in CHATGPT_RESEARCH_QUEUE.md is 'QUEUED'

**NightShift not running:**
- Check system temp: `sensors`
- Verify queue: `sqlite3 nightshift_queue.db "SELECT * FROM packages;"`
