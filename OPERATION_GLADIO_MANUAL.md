# Test data entry system
python3 gladio_data_entry.py
```

### Phase 2: Systematic Data Entry
```bash
# Interactive data entry mode
python3 gladio_data_entry.py

# Quick entry mode for bulk data
# Format: TYPE|NAME|DETAILS|PAGE
# Example: PERSON|Stefano Delle Chiaie|Italian fascist, Ordine Nuovo|p.123
```

### Phase 3: Analysis and Validation
```bash
# Generate network analysis
python3 gladio_analysis.py

# Export comprehensive reports
python3 gladio_analysis.py --export-all
```

### Phase 4: Intelligence Synthesis
