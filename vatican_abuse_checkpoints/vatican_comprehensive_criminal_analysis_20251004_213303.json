  "executive_summary": {
    "overview": "This intelligence analysis examines documented and alleged criminal activity and institutional complicity by the Vatican across multiple operational domains spanning 1940s-2025. Evidence reveals systematic patterns of secrecy, financial crimes, and protection of criminal elements, with documented connections to organized crime, intelligence agencies, and authoritarian regimes.",
    "key_finding": "Sexual abuse cover-up (1962-2003+) represents one component of a broader institutional pattern characterized by: (1) Systematic secrecy protocols, (2) Financial crimes and money laundering, (3) Collaboration with criminal/intelligence networks, (4) Exploitation of diplomatic immunity, (5) Multi-decade continuity of criminal structures",
    "confidence_assessment": "Medium-High: Mix of confirmed convictions, authenticated documents, credible investigative journalism, and expert legal analysis. Some connections (e.g., Operation Gladio) based on investigative research rather than declassified documents."
